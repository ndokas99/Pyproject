Start=11250><P class='en'>garbage anime villain within a week of<SYNC Start=13290><P class='en'>it hitting 15,000 likes well apparently<SYNC Start=16139><P class='en'>you guys liked it I don&#39;t know a fifteen<SYNC Start=18210><P class='en'>thousand likes right away so here you go<SYNC Start=20070><P class='en'>from five early signs of a garbage anime<SYNC Start=22769><P class='en'>villain this is a completely educational<SYNC Start=25740><P class='en'>non meme whatsoever our video that is<SYNC Start=28769><P class='en'>purely to help you in your quest to<SYNC Start=31349><P class='en'>picking out absolutely trash enemy<SYNC Start=33180><P class='en'>villains right from the start you&#39;ll<SYNC Start=35010><P class='en'>find it&#39;s much easier than you think<SYNC Start=36450><P class='en'>after you see these five clauses that<SYNC Start=39480><P class='en'>are nearly invisible to the naked eye<SYNC Start=41460><P class='en'>that once elucidated will shine forth on<SYNC Start=44010><P class='en'>some how most two enemy villains but<SYNC Start=45780><P class='en'>that&#39;s not the point the point is this<SYNC Start=47910><P class='en'>is purely as a public service video to<SYNC Start=51750><P class='en'>help and not to completely just mask<SYNC Start=54570><P class='en'>this as an excuse to sarcastically<SYNC Start=56100><P class='en'>insult anime villains or a thinly veiled<SYNC Start=58289><P class='en'>excuse to crap over anime not for any<SYNC Start=60660><P class='en'>particular reason aside from the fact<SYNC Start=62370><P class='en'>that it&#39;s a hell of a lot of fun okay<SYNC Start=63960><P class='en'>good well it&#39;s time to up the ante when<SYNC Start=67860><P class='en'>this video hits 20,000 likes within a<SYNC Start=71790><P class='en'>week from hitting that or perhaps<SYNC Start=73470><P class='en'>earlier if I never hit that I will be<SYNC Start=75479><P class='en'>making a video 5 early signs of a<SYNC Start=77700><P class='en'>garbage anime fight and I actually think<SYNC Start=80310><P class='en'>that&#39;s gonna be a pretty dope one so<SYNC Start=81900><P class='en'>like away fanbase and let us begin with<SYNC Start=84869><P class='en'>early sign of a garbage villain number 1<SYNC Start=87090><P class='en'>as you are all aware before meeting the<SYNC Start=89250><P class='en'>main villain ever you always end up<SYNC Start=91650><P class='en'>meeting his army of cronies because what<SYNC Start=94200><P class='en'>villain can properly do anything without<SYNC Start=96210><P class='en'>an army of cronies II you get what I&#39;m<SYNC Start=98280><P class='en'>saying<SYNC Start=98670><P class='en'>now the sign that it&#39;s a garbage villain<SYNC Start=100799><P class='en'>is simply due to what the cronies add to<SYNC Start=104159><P class='en'>the story first and foremost if there&#39;s<SYNC Start=106049><P class='en'>a number of cronies that&#39;s a bad sign<SYNC Start=107880><P class='en'>the 9 Akatsuki the seven sins of<SYNC Start=110549><P class='en'>purgatory the Arashi on six the nine<SYNC Start=113340><P class='en'>gates of hell the 10 Espada the 13<SYNC Start=116759><P class='en'>members of the phantom troupe the 10<SYNC Start=118979><P class='en'>commandments the seven homunculus the<SYNC Start=122070><P class='en'>sense we 7 if the villain group tells<SYNC Start=124710><P class='en'>you the amount of villains in the group<SYNC Start=126450><P class='en'>in the name of the group well then I<SYNC Start=128520><P class='en'>can&#39;t commend the leadership skills of<SYNC Start=131160><P class='en'>whoever&#39;s running the thing it&#39;s like<SYNC Start=132660><P class='en'>this<SYNC Start=133250><P class='en'>each group of several people that<SYNC Start=135050><P class='en'>operates in the shadows and they&#39;re all<SYNC Start=136670><P class='en'>badass and they&#39;re so badass and secrets<SYNC Start=139700><P class='en'>in fact we&#39;re gonna tell you exactly how<SYNC Start=141260><P class='en'>many of them there are so they can match<SYNC Start=142970><P class='en'>up exactly equally to all of the main<SYNC Start=145040><P class='en'>characters that fight them they all lose<SYNC Start=146750><P class='en'>one-on-one fights and then the main<SYNC Start=148280><P class='en'>character takes down the main bad guy I<SYNC Start=150230><P class='en'>see this as relatively counter<SYNC Start=152030><P class='en'>production in the art of stealth and it<SYNC Start=154190><P class='en'>does not bode well if the main villain<SYNC Start=156350><P class='en'>thinks it&#39;s a pretty wacky cool idea to<SYNC Start=158870><P class='en'>put a number in the title of his group<SYNC Start=160400><P class='en'>but in any case that&#39;s not the only<SYNC Start=162230><P class='en'>thing we can see from the cronies you<SYNC Start=164030><P class='en'>can immediately tell if there&#39;s a little<SYNC Start=166280><P class='en'>bit wrong fishy with the melon if you<SYNC Start=169010><P class='en'>know they end up fighting the guys in<SYNC Start=170480><P class='en'>the group one at a time or at least in<SYNC Start=172220><P class='en'>pairs or whatever the hell obviously the<SYNC Start=174530><P class='en'>number in the group is to scare everyone<SYNC Start=176209><P class='en'>else because each of them is so powerful<SYNC Start=178250><P class='en'>in fact more often than not on an<SYNC Start=180680><P class='en'>individual level a single member from<SYNC Start=182810><P class='en'>one of these groups should be able to<SYNC Start=183830><P class='en'>take out throngs of good guys well<SYNC Start=185900><P class='en'>imagine putting them all together one<SYNC Start=188720><P class='en'>place the main villain is so smart in<SYNC Start=191150><P class='en'>stealthy that&#39;ll only send them one at a<SYNC Start=193520><P class='en'>time Power Rangers style to defeat the<SYNC Start=195890><P class='en'>good guys and honestly they&#39;re defeated<SYNC Start=198230><P class='en'>by teamwork and stuff so great plan<SYNC Start=200420><P class='en'>their main bad guy then the main bad guy<SYNC Start=202549><P class='en'>secretly is more powerful than all of<SYNC Start=204110><P class='en'>them put together so he didn&#39;t really<SYNC Start=205190><P class='en'>need them which begs the question why he<SYNC Start=206660><P class='en'>originally had at them and that&#39;s<SYNC Start=208130><P class='en'>because he didn&#39;t want to get his hands<SYNC Start=209480><P class='en'>muddied in the dirty work of the world<SYNC Start=211549><P class='en'>shut up main bad guy if you&#39;re sending<SYNC Start=213830><P class='en'>out your cronies individually to die but<SYNC Start=216200><P class='en'>it doesn&#39;t actually bother you because<SYNC Start=217430><P class='en'>you&#39;re secretly way stronger than all of<SYNC Start=218870><P class='en'>them put together for shame I mean<SYNC Start=221330><P class='en'>literally I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going<SYNC Start=222500><P class='en'>through the guy&#39;s head for the same<SYNC Start=223940><P class='en'>exact price he could have been a<SYNC Start=225500><P class='en'>relatively good guy still be overpowered<SYNC Start=227870><P class='en'>and then by default amass a harem of<SYNC Start=230299><P class='en'>anime whamon by his sides to defeat the<SYNC Start=232579><P class='en'>forces of evil but there&#39;s more that you<SYNC Start=234410><P class='en'>can learn about the cronies more often<SYNC Start=236180><P class='en'>than not if the cronies around purely to<SYNC Start=238700><P class='en'>hype the abilities of the main bad guy<SYNC Start=241220><P class='en'>then you didn&#39;t really need the chrony<SYNC Start=242780><P class='en'>there at all and he was just their type<SYNC Start=244250><P class='en'>the main bad guy further this main bad<SYNC Start=246350><P class='en'>guy is walking around with a hype squad<SYNC Start=248930><P class='en'>a literal group of elite doofuses to<SYNC Start=251720><P class='en'>purely flex on the haters I mean in like<SYNC Start=254269><P class='en'>the seven deadly sins when Goliath first<SYNC Start=256250><P class='en'>fought the sins the sins power level<SYNC Start=258169><P class='en'>averaged at around 3,000 each and you<SYNC Start=260450><P class='en'>land at a power level of like 26,000 he<SYNC Start=263000><P class='en'>completely obliterated them and then of<SYNC Start=265010><P class='en'>course he was secretly<SYNC Start=266120><P class='en'>the weakest of the 10 commandments all<SYNC Start=268010><P class='en'>along and then every sin manages to get<SYNC Start=270800><P class='en'>crazy power boosts way over power all of<SYNC Start=272750><P class='en'>them and bam demon king five hundred<SYNC Start=274940><P class='en'>thousand power level yeah Goliath was<SYNC Start=277400><P class='en'>really helpful wasn&#39;t he or you have<SYNC Start=279380><P class='en'>someone like Aizen and bleach and his<SYNC Start=281180><P class='en'>epic group of Espada each with a number<SYNC Start=283699><P class='en'>ranking them and power from lowest to<SYNC Start=286340><P class='en'>highest and then he kind of just left a<SYNC Start=288500><P class='en'>bunch of them in hueco mundo to die off<SYNC Start=290270><P class='en'>fighting some of the captains that were<SYNC Start=291949><P class='en'>there while he invaded the human world<SYNC Start=293360><P class='en'>now if he&#39;s already raking them<SYNC Start=295310><P class='en'>consecutively from weakest to strongest<SYNC Start=296810><P class='en'>and they&#39;re fighting them taking them<SYNC Start=298610><P class='en'>down one at a time of course none of the<SYNC Start=300889><P class='en'>Espada thought it was a good idea to<SYNC Start=302090><P class='en'>team up against the Soul Reapers but hey<SYNC Start=304280><P class='en'>I&#39;m not the tactical mastermind here and<SYNC Start=306860><P class='en'>it&#39;s not even that Aizen was stupid in<SYNC Start=308540><P class='en'>this regard aizen&#39;s a freaking genius he<SYNC Start=310790><P class='en'>didn&#39;t need the Espada they were just<SYNC Start=312139><P class='en'>kind of there to make the fights cooler<SYNC Start=313610><P class='en'>he could have just invaded the human<SYNC Start=315290><P class='en'>world with his entire group of Espada<SYNC Start=317180><P class='en'>and then oh my god ichigo byakuya<SYNC Start=320150><P class='en'>kampachi and all the other guys that<SYNC Start=322130><P class='en'>were there are gonna be trapped in hueco<SYNC Start=323720><P class='en'>mundo until they find a way out well<SYNC Start=325430><P class='en'>everyone is on his side to deal with<SYNC Start=327320><P class='en'>them but no they&#39;re just too flexed so<SYNC Start=329449><P class='en'>therefore it&#39;s much cooler if they have<SYNC Start=330979><P class='en'>individual fights so that is side one of<SYNC Start=333320><P class='en'>a potentially garbage anime villain keep<SYNC Start=335330><P class='en'>an eye on the cronies but now let&#39;s get<SYNC Start=337130><P class='en'>into the meat and potatoes of the man<SYNC Start=338990><P class='en'>himself I don&#39;t see man to some sexist<SYNC Start=341090><P class='en'>they say man because there are very few<SYNC Start=342680><P class='en'>enemy whamming that are actually main<SYNC Start=344810><P class='en'>villains too if the main villain is<SYNC Start=346940><P class='en'>actually an enemy whamon now not trying<SYNC Start=349639><P class='en'>to insult anyone here by saying this but<SYNC Start=352160><P class='en'>let&#39;s be frank I made a list of the top<SYNC Start=354500><P class='en'>10 anime villains and they also had like<SYNC Start=356510><P class='en'>20 honorable mentions not gonna lie<SYNC Start=358820><P class='en'>don&#39;t think any were whamon which is<SYNC Start=361160><P class='en'>very sad gender equality is extremely<SYNC Start=363740><P class='en'>important and must be stressed so<SYNC Start=365690><P class='en'>therefore I think it&#39;s crucial to say<SYNC Start=367789><P class='en'>that anime whamon should have the right<SYNC Start=369560><P class='en'>to be amazing villains as well but<SYNC Start=371240><P class='en'>they&#39;re not they&#39;re like oh here&#39;s an<SYNC Start=372830><P class='en'>epic anime whamon villain Kaguya yeah<SYNC Start=375110><P class='en'>that&#39;s right literally farted out of<SYNC Start=376940><P class='en'>Kishimoto z-- but just because he didn&#39;t<SYNC Start=378979><P class='en'>want modern to be the main villain or<SYNC Start=380419><P class='en'>something early signs of a garbage anime<SYNC Start=382610><P class='en'>villain if they pop out of nowhere with<SYNC Start=384620><P class='en'>zero hype but secretly<SYNC Start=386060><P class='en'>they&#39;re the alien goddess overpowered<SYNC Start=388400><P class='en'>creature that will take over the planet<SYNC Start=390380><P class='en'>with their insane abilities and shiz but<SYNC Start=392300><P class='en'>of course there is one exception to this<SYNC Start=394010><P class='en'>an exception where an anime villain can<SYNC Start=396349><P class='en'>actually be both good and<SYNC Start=398600><P class='en'>Waymon and that is if they were secretly<SYNC Start=400670><P class='en'>in love with the main character and it<SYNC Start=402560><P class='en'>doesn&#39;t even need to be so secret the<SYNC Start=404150><P class='en'>main villain andrey creators as well as<SYNC Start=405980><P class='en'>s death from a cameo kill show that with<SYNC Start=408170><P class='en'>spades strong women loving the main<SYNC Start=410600><P class='en'>character or something along those lines<SYNC Start=412700><P class='en'>so it&#39;s not that we have no epic anime<SYNC Start=415370><P class='en'>villain whamon but it&#39;s usually a<SYNC Start=416930><P class='en'>telltale sign that it&#39;s not gonna be the<SYNC Start=418910><P class='en'>most wonderful villain on the face of<SYNC Start=420380><P class='en'>the planet<SYNC Start=420890><P class='en'>not trying to be sexist here or anything<SYNC Start=422420><P class='en'>I am just once again advocating gender<SYNC Start=425720><P class='en'>equality saying that women have the<SYNC Start=427640><P class='en'>right to be terribly horrible anime<SYNC Start=430370><P class='en'>villains as well and I want to see women<SYNC Start=432950><P class='en'>being destroyed by the main characters<SYNC Start=434630><P class='en'>and extremely brutal ways that didn&#39;t<SYNC Start=436640><P class='en'>come out right<SYNC Start=437240><P class='en'>anyway moving on sign number three and<SYNC Start=439550><P class='en'>once again this is a bit of a<SYNC Start=441050><P class='en'>conglomerate early sign of a garbage<SYNC Start=443690><P class='en'>anime villain and it&#39;s anything that<SYNC Start=445700><P class='en'>involves building up the villains<SYNC Start=447830><P class='en'>ideology so now there are some really<SYNC Start=450260><P class='en'>epic villains really cool psychologies<SYNC Start=452270><P class='en'>and ideology but unfortunately the vast<SYNC Start=454130><P class='en'>majority do not fall under those exact<SYNC Start=456440><P class='en'>guidelines if the main villain is<SYNC Start=458660><P class='en'>actually related to the main character<SYNC Start=460850><P class='en'>because he was either trained by the<SYNC Start=462560><P class='en'>same master or he was the master or he<SYNC Start=465470><P class='en'>was the wayward student or he was his<SYNC Start=467630><P class='en'>father or his uncle or his stepbrothers<SYNC Start=469730><P class='en'>pet goat you know there&#39;s a problem you<SYNC Start=471830><P class='en'>have this massive world with this<SYNC Start=473330><P class='en'>probably underdog protagonist that&#39;s<SYNC Start=475490><P class='en'>gonna try to claw his way up from the<SYNC Start=477140><P class='en'>very bottom where no one expected<SYNC Start=478490><P class='en'>anything of him surprise the main<SYNC Start=480650><P class='en'>villain all along is literally just like<SYNC Start=483380><P class='en'>him to some degree let&#39;s look at some<SYNC Start=485660><P class='en'>villains in Naruto pain trained by the<SYNC Start=488090><P class='en'>same master Madara from the same clan as<SYNC Start=491120><P class='en'>the other main character there we go we<SYNC Start=493370><P class='en'>got both main characters to have their<SYNC Start=495320><P class='en'>step cousins attempt world domination<SYNC Start=497780><P class='en'>lovely who&#39;s the main villain in the<SYNC Start=499400><P class='en'>seven deadly sins well is it Mele Otis&#39;s<SYNC Start=502040><P class='en'>father what that&#39;s like the craziest<SYNC Start=505160><P class='en'>coincidence ever but it gets better why<SYNC Start=508490><P class='en'>did the villain become evil this is<SYNC Start=510650><P class='en'>again part of the upbringing and an<SYNC Start=512659><P class='en'>early sign of a garbage anime villain as<SYNC Start=514909><P class='en'>if his reasoning to go off the hinges<SYNC Start=516770><P class='en'>off the wall nutso is not exactly<SYNC Start=519409><P class='en'>something that would befall most people<SYNC Start=521210><P class='en'>in their exact situations once again<SYNC Start=523460><P class='en'>let&#39;s look at Naruto for a moment<SYNC Start=525290><P class='en'>Payne&#39;s friend died so because that&#39;s<SYNC Start=527780><P class='en'>very sad he decided world domination<SYNC Start=530810><P class='en'>Audra was just a humble dude that didn&#39;t<SYNC Start=533150><P class='en'>feel like the UGA clan were being<SYNC Start=534590><P class='en'>treated fairly in the Lee village world<SYNC Start=536540><P class='en'>domination Thai boys<SYNC Start=538220><P class='en'>Obito sacrificed himself for his friend<SYNC Start=540650><P class='en'>for the good of the world and then it<SYNC Start=542270><P class='en'>turns out that the person that he wanted<SYNC Start=544490><P class='en'>to save most ended up dying<SYNC Start=546860><P class='en'>well did his uh his wife who just died<SYNC Start=548779><P class='en'>well in I think that calls for world<SYNC Start=550190><P class='en'>domination ladies and gentlemen world<SYNC Start=551900><P class='en'>domination in general is a bad sign it&#39;s<SYNC Start=554240><P class='en'>a way to say the universe effed you so<SYNC Start=556460><P class='en'>it&#39;s time to eff the universe and it&#39;s<SYNC Start=558320><P class='en'>not exactly a logic that most of us<SYNC Start=559970><P class='en'>follow<SYNC Start=560570><P class='en'>I lied that&#39;s a logic that way too many<SYNC Start=562520><P class='en'>of us follow unfortunately but it<SYNC Start=564260><P class='en'>shouldn&#39;t be but now it doesn&#39;t only<SYNC Start=566240><P class='en'>apply to villains that decided they<SYNC Start=568430><P class='en'>wanted to take over the world because<SYNC Start=569900><P class='en'>that one time they stubbed their toe is<SYNC Start=571910><P class='en'>way too painful and it forced them to<SYNC Start=573529><P class='en'>become evil and they have some crazy<SYNC Start=575270><P class='en'>reasoning as to why that works out but<SYNC Start=576920><P class='en'>it applies to any villain who has that<SYNC Start=578390><P class='en'>exact same ideology you have some dope<SYNC Start=580550><P class='en'>villains like staying from my hero<SYNC Start=582440><P class='en'>academia due to this powerful ideology<SYNC Start=584779><P class='en'>that caused his view of the world to<SYNC Start=587000><P class='en'>warp into something different he had a<SYNC Start=588920><P class='en'>different view of what makes a hero he<SYNC Start=590990><P class='en'>followed this path of his with such an<SYNC Start=593060><P class='en'>intense passion his pure willpower alone<SYNC Start=596330><P class='en'>was enough to terrify the heroes<SYNC Start=598520><P class='en'>detaining him after he was defeated that<SYNC Start=600560><P class='en'>is a powerful ideology for a villain<SYNC Start=602540><P class='en'>it&#39;s a great reason for him to do what<SYNC Start=604190><P class='en'>he&#39;s doing not to say that I fully agree<SYNC Start=605960><P class='en'>and can condone the idea of killing good<SYNC Start=609050><P class='en'>people because they&#39;re not good for the<SYNC Start=610550><P class='en'>right reasons not exactly what I&#39;m<SYNC Start=612440><P class='en'>trying to push here fam but then you<SYNC Start=614600><P class='en'>compare him to other villains in the<SYNC Start=615980><P class='en'>series like I don&#39;t know<SYNC Start=617150><P class='en'>Tamura Palmer is a pretty great villain<SYNC Start=619280><P class='en'>and uh that&#39;s all lovely but ask him his<SYNC Start=621530><P class='en'>motivations and it might give you a<SYNC Start=623000><P class='en'>telltale sign of what he&#39;s willing to<SYNC Start=624710><P class='en'>become so tomorrow what do you want to<SYNC Start=626630><P class='en'>do well I wouldn&#39;t kill all might<SYNC Start=628550><P class='en'>because he&#39;s good and I&#39;m evil Wow Tomer<SYNC Start=631670><P class='en'>are very cool but uh<SYNC Start=633020><P class='en'>all-4-one was the guy training you what<SYNC Start=634940><P class='en'>does he plan on doing oh he just wants<SYNC Start=637040><P class='en'>to destroy the world or take it over or<SYNC Start=639260><P class='en'>make evil reign supreme or whatever very<SYNC Start=641150><P class='en'>epic ideologies right here fan and it&#39;s<SYNC Start=643550><P class='en'>not at all an early sign of a garbage<SYNC

backing up what they&#39;re doing<SYNC Start=745910><P class='en'>however even so that does not completely<SYNC Start=748430><P class='en'>save them this is an early sign of a<SYNC Start=750500><P

Start=757250><P class='en'>the right motives and even with no hype<SYNC Start=759350><P class='en'>and not necessarily related to the main<SYNC Start=761780><P class='en'>character if everything was part of<SYNC Start=763580><P class='en'>their plan sorry fam that is not how it<SYNC Start=766670><P class='en'>works and I do not relate to you except<SYNC Start=768980><P class='en'>for Aizen you&#39;re amazing and I do relate<SYNC Start=770870><P class='en'>to you I made a whole video on Aizen<SYNC Start=772370><P class='en'>he&#39;s amazing check it out not the point<SYNC Start=774500><P class='en'>if everything was secretly part of your<SYNC Start=776210><P class='en'>evil plan then nothing was I don&#39;t think<SYNC Start=779060><P class='en'>that&#39;s how that line works but we&#39;re<SYNC Start=780290><P class='en'>gonna go with it anyway hahaha I knew<SYNC Start=782510><P class='en'>you would take three steps forward on<SYNC Start=783830><P class='en'>this very day and I have planned this<SYNC Start=785840><P class='en'>trap 14 years ago expecting your arrival<SYNC Start=788810><P class='en'>right now but how do you know because I<SYNC Start=790940><P class='en'>dyed it every moment in your life making<SYNC Start=792680><P class='en'>you just as strong as you are now so<SYNC Start=794540><P class='en'>that you could be here taking these<SYNC Start=795920><P class='en'>three steps and I am very cool but<SYNC Start=798480><P class='en'>but how is that possible silence I do<SYNC Start=800310><P class='en'>not need to answer questions from you<SYNC Start=801690><P class='en'>fools not a good sign for an enemy<SYNC Start=803459><P class='en'>villain want to know a way better<SYNC Start=804990><P class='en'>approach to the exact same scenario but<SYNC Start=807269><P class='en'>changes it all into a much better light<SYNC Start=809550><P class='en'>I have planned out your entire life<SYNC Start=811350><P class='en'>since your very birth knowing that you<SYNC Start=813149><P class='en'>would take these 3 steps exactly right<SYNC Start=815250><P class='en'>now here today at this exact power level<SYNC Start=817709><P class='en'>you&#39;re at because they pitted every<SYNC Start=818850><P class='en'>opponent against you to make you just as<SYNC Start=820199><P class='en'>strong as you could possibly be to have<SYNC Start=821610><P class='en'>the most epic fight against me where you<SYNC Start=823050><P class='en'>just barely win and then when the main<SYNC Start=824760><P class='en'>character says how did you know if you<SYNC Start=828180><P class='en'>would have gone with the generic silence<SYNC Start=829980><P class='en'>fool or because I am very cool answer<SYNC Start=832470><P class='en'>not a good sign for a villain but he<SYNC Start=834120><P class='en'>would say oh how did I know because it&#39;s<SYNC Start=836279><P class='en'>me do that is top to your signs of an<SYNC Start=839010><P class='en'>enemy village and I know that&#39;s not<SYNC Start=840120><P class='en'>exactly what this video was supposed to<SYNC Start=841350><P class='en'>be but I just had to talk about a very<SYNC Start=843300><P class='en'>easy way to get out of the entire<SYNC Start=844920><P class='en'>situation and if you really want to add<SYNC Start=846690><P class='en'>some spice when the main villain says so<SYNC Start=848430><P class='en'>he planned out your entire life the good<SYNC Start=849990><P class='en'>guys supposed to say Nami and then the<SYNC Start=852360><P class='en'>bad guy could skip right to what does<SYNC Start=853920><P class='en'>you uh do this and then you know it<SYNC Start=856709><P class='en'>evolves into an epic battle but not<SYNC Start=858360><P class='en'>every anime is JoJo&#39;s and I understand<SYNC Start=860399><P class='en'>why not every anime is amazing to that<SYNC Start=862139><P class='en'>degree of writing however if he planned<SYNC Start=864449><P class='en'>out your entire life and he&#39;s not gonna<SYNC Start=865889><P class='en'>give you a logical way how he did it not<SYNC Start=867779><P class='en'>a great sign of a villain black zetsu<SYNC Start=869519><P class='en'>screw yourself and as far as the fifth<SYNC Start=871920><P class='en'>and final early sign of a garbage anime<SYNC Start=875190><P class='en'>villain their powers I know this sounds<SYNC Start=877620><P class='en'>generic and very surface level stuff I&#39;m<SYNC Start=879690><P class='en'>skipping all the themes not talking<SYNC Start=881670><P class='en'>about any of the philosophy of the<SYNC Start=883139><P class='en'>series no psychology no ideology no<SYNC Start=885769><P class='en'>astrophysics or whatever the hell else I<SYNC Start=888180><P class='en'>talk about in my analysis videos where I<SYNC Start=889740><P class='en'>make believe I&#39;m smart and whatever no<SYNC Start=891329><P class='en'>fewer basic powers if the guy could drop<SYNC Start=894060><P class='en'>a meteor that&#39;s actually really cool so<SYNC Start=896010><P class='en'>I&#39;m gonna give him either a pass on that<SYNC Start=897300><P class='en'>one but if you&#39;re a guy like lark aid<SYNC Start=899490><P class='en'>from Fairy Tail or in fact speaking of<SYNC Start=902100><P class='en'>Fairy Tail let&#39;s use that as a prime<SYNC Start=903870><P class='en'>example of this one I don&#39;t want to go<SYNC Start=905670><P class='en'>far off topic here but some powers are<SYNC Start=908399><P class='en'>so broken it doesn&#39;t make sense how<SYNC Start=910260><P class='en'>they&#39;re defeated and it&#39;s not like I<SYNC Start=911639><P class='en'>want to make fun of Fairy Tail or<SYNC Start=912930><P class='en'>anything here it&#39;s not exactly what I&#39;m<SYNC Start=914519><P class='en'>being paid for but it&#39;s a prime example<SYNC Start=916050><P class='en'>as far as this bryggen 12 when the power<SYNC Start=918510><P class='en'>levels get out of control Larke aid<SYNC Start=920399><P class='en'>dragged Neil from Fairy Tail is part of<SYNC Start=923190><P class='en'>this bryggen 12 this extremely<SYNC Start=924779><P class='en'>overpowered enemy organization and you<SYNC Start=927120><P class='en'>know immediately that there&#39;s an issue<SYNC Start=928560><P class='en'>because this brigand 12 just there<SYNC Start=932100><P class='en'>hi bubs Arif very cool fairytale again<SYNC Start=934350><P class='en'>not the point<SYNC Start=935579><P class='en'>I think that enemy got the point lark<SYNC Start=937800><P class='en'>AIDS abilities include you know having<SYNC Start=940620><P class='en'>everyone within a certain radius of him<SYNC Start=943529><P class='en'>go into such major orgasms that they<SYNC Start=945990><P class='en'>cannot seem to fight that is correct<SYNC Start=948089><P class='en'>of course he immediately runs into<SYNC Start=950250><P class='en'>battle against like three whamon and all<SYNC Start=952440><P class='en'>three of those women all of a sudden<SYNC Start=954029><P class='en'>start squealing and breathing heavy and<SYNC Start=956220><P class='en'>they fall on the ground and they&#39;re<SYNC Start=957420><P class='en'>touching themselves in weird places and<SYNC Start=959449><P class='en'>Mark aid is one of the greatest villains<SYNC Start=961680><P class='en'>in anime I take that all back his other<SYNC Start=963930><P class='en'>incredible moves include making everyone<SYNC Start=966209><P class='en'>around him suffer from hunger so since<SYNC Start=968339><P class='en'>they&#39;re hungry all the anime characters<SYNC Start=970529><P class='en'>around him<SYNC Start=971130><P class='en'>mostly ramen as we&#39;ve already<SYNC Start=972420><P class='en'>established start licking each other and<SYNC Start=974670><P class='en'>chewing on each other and taking off<SYNC Start=976380><P class='en'>each others clothes to bite each other<SYNC Start=978120><P class='en'>in better place I don&#39;t know where Kate<SYNC Start=980250><P class='en'>is one of the greatest villains of all<SYNC Start=981420><P class='en'>time what am I saying here I don&#39;t even<SYNC Start=983310><P class='en'>know how I&#39;m insulting the guy and<SYNC Start=984870><P class='en'>you&#39;ll even notice a pretty funny trend<SYNC Start=986850><P class='en'>here one of these friggin twelve is this<SYNC Start=988529><P class='en'>assassin dude and he has the ability to<SYNC Start=990569><P class='en'>trap everyone around him into this<SYNC Start=991860><P class='en'>little pocket dimension that he holds in<SYNC Start=993329><P class='en'>his palm completely destroying them and<SYNC Start=994889><P class='en'>defeating them without even needing to<SYNC Start=995970><P class='en'>fight them no matter how powerful they<SYNC Start=997769><P class='en'>are no matter who they are<SYNC Start=998880><P class='en'>blammo yes he only does it once because<SYNC Start=1001040><P class='en'>otherwise it would be crazy o P but<SYNC Start=1002779><P class='en'>they&#39;re all trapped in little pocket<SYNC Start=1003769><P class='en'>dimension since it&#39;s so overpowered and<SYNC Start=1005660><P class='en'>ridiculously strong I don&#39;t see how<SYNC Start=1007519><P class='en'>anyone can ever defeat him in fact I<SYNC Start=1009500><P class='en'>think he might be able to defeat all of<SYNC Start=1011300><P class='en'>Fairy Tail however he&#39;s extremely shy<SYNC Start=1013459><P class='en'>and if he sees a ramen that is not fully<SYNC Start=1015139><P class='en'>clothed he&#39;ll be too embarrassed to<SYNC Start=1016550><P class='en'>fight close his eyes and the web and<SYNC Start=1017959><P class='en'>will then defeat him spoilers Lucy was<SYNC Start=1019939><P class='en'>completely naked and managed to teleport<SYNC Start=1021740><P class='en'>right in front of him<SYNC Start=1022670><P class='en'>epic win for Fairy Tail other crazy<SYNC Start=1025010><P class='en'>overpowered characters from this bryggen<SYNC Start=1026839><P class='en'>12 include this guy that can look into<SYNC Start=1029600><P class='en'>all of the opponent&#39;s memories or even<SYNC Start=1032058><P class='en'>his friends memories and every foe that<SYNC Start=1034220><P class='en'>they&#39;ve ever fought is now reese<SYNC Start=1035630><P class='en'>summoned back maybe not at their full<SYNC Start=1037280><P class='en'>power but at most of their power that<SYNC Start=1038990><P class='en'>they would have to fight them again so<SYNC Start=1040400><P class='en'>that means even though a bunch of this<SYNC Start=1041928><P class='en'>bryggen 12 are actually defeated he can<SYNC Start=1044058><P class='en'>then re summon their memories from the<SYNC Start=1047480><P class='en'>dead and they&#39;re basically as strong as<SYNC Start=1049280><P class='en'>they were before and annihilating all<SYNC Start=1050720><P class='en'>their progress probably one of the most<SYNC Start=1052220><P class='en'>overpowered broken abilities ever that<SYNC Start=1053809><P class='en'>most anime wouldn&#39;t even dare touch but<SYNC Start=1055820><P class='en'>Fairy Tail is so epic they came up with<SYNC Start=1057890><P class='en'>a villain it&#39;s so strong now uh this<SYNC Start=1060200><P class='en'>villain decide to go hand-to-hand fight<SYNC Start=1062390><P class='en'>some opponents and not unite<SYNC Start=1065250><P class='en'>yeah and the hand fights with the guy<SYNC Start=1066929><P class='en'>who has the most overpowered ability<SYNC Start=1068549><P class='en'>every and to just sit in his castle<SYNC Start=1069990><P class='en'>making an endless army of foes they&#39;ve<SYNC Start=1072179><P class='en'>already defeated constantly revive and<SYNC Start=1074340><P class='en'>continue to fight them very cool but the<SYNC Start=1076740><P class='en'>problem isn&#39;t even that he had to fight<SYNC Start=1078000><P class='en'>them hand-to-hand because we know that<SYNC Start=1079890><P class='en'>he had to be defeated eventually the<SYNC Start=1081330><P class='en'>power is once you introduce any ability<SYNC Start=1083789><P class='en'>so strong there&#39;s no way you could get<SYNC Start=1085650><P class='en'>around it like Irene for example from<SYNC Start=1087900><P class='en'>fairytale versus mother crazy powerful<SYNC Start=1090510><P class='en'>wizard one of this friggin twelve one of<SYNC Start=1092309><P class='en'>the three strongest to this bryggen<SYNC Start=1093690><P class='en'>twelve in fact she used a single move<SYNC Start=1095610><P class='en'>that rearranged the entire continent<SYNC Start=1099240><P class='en'>they were standing on to destroy the<SYNC Start=1101340><P class='en'>enemy battle lines and to get certain<SYNC Start=1102929><P class='en'>people in different places now if you<SYNC Start=1104820><P class='en'>want to talk Opie broken abilities you<SYNC Start=1106679><P class='en'>don&#39;t get much more than that she did it<SYNC Start=1108270><P class='en'>with the snap of the fingers how<SYNC Start=1109770><P class='en'>ridiculous is that well unfortunately<SYNC Start=1111480><P class='en'>she was in the range of lark aide who<SYNC Start=1114270><P class='en'>caused her to start orgasming so she<SYNC Start=1115799><P class='en'>couldn&#39;t really continue the fight and<SYNC Start=1117000><P class='en'>she had to retreat for now Wow now I&#39;m<SYNC Start=1121770><P class='en'>not making this an excuse to bag on<SYNC Start=1123330><P class='en'>fairy tale I just feel like the spring<SYNC Start=1124799><P class='en'>in 12 were built to be so overpowered<SYNC Start=1126900><P class='en'>with such wacky abilities all of them<SYNC Start=1129090><P class='en'>really have the potential to be an<SYNC Start=1131130><P class='en'>absolutely trash atom even they&#39;re not<SYNC Start=1132510><P class='en'>saying that they are I&#39;m just saying<SYNC Start=1134250><P class='en'>these characteristics are sometimes<SYNC Start=1136200><P class='en'>telling I mean there&#39;s the woman that<SYNC Start=1137850><P class='en'>can trap everyone in Tsavo stop time<SYNC Start=1140700><P class='en'>walk up to them and stop time and<SYNC Start=1142230><P class='en'>annihilate them but Natsu was so strong<SYNC Start=1144929><P class='en'>he was able to lay time on fire and<SYNC Start=1147870><P class='en'>defeat her yeah anime logic 101 don&#39;t<SYNC Start=1151020><P class='en'>make the villain too overpowered with<SYNC Start=1153030><P class='en'>such broken abilities that it doesn&#39;t<SYNC Start=1154890><P class='en'>make any sense how they&#39;re defeated one<SYNC Start=1156210><P class='en'>of the early signs for a garbage villain<SYNC Start=1157980><P class='en'>is if the ability is that broken but<SYNC Start=1160320><P class='en'>again this is not to bag on fairy tale<SYNC Start=1162059><P class='en'>at the end of seven at least in season<SYNC Start=1164190><P class='en'>one which is a series that I actually do<SYNC Start=1166350><P class='en'>like a lot just like fairy tale being<SYNC Start=1168450><P class='en'>that I&#39;m one of the few anime youtubers<SYNC Start=1169980><P class='en'>that praises Fairy Tail for the things<SYNC Start=1171630><P class='en'>that does well hendrickson gets gray<SYNC Start=1173460><P class='en'>demon abilities and of course gray<SYNC Start=1175110><P class='en'>demons end up completely useless in the<SYNC Start=1176700><P class='en'>scheme of things<SYNC Start=1177480><P class='en'>but with his great demon ability he<SYNC Start=1179159><P class='en'>manages to use this black snow thing go<SYNC Start=1181470><P class='en'>that anyone that comes in contact with<SYNC Start=1183270><P class='en'>this black powder thing automatically<SYNC Start=1185130><P class='en'>dies yes that is a very broken power no<SYNC Start=1188429><P class='en'>he does not use it on the seven deadly<SYNC Start=1190020><P class='en'>sins he only does it on nameless<SYNC Start=1191730><P class='en'>characters that die and it&#39;s like we<SYNC Start=1193649><P class='en'>don&#39;t really care but it actually hits<SYNC Start=1195899><P class='en'>Hawk the pig the mascot of the series<SYNC Start=1198179><P class='en'>Hauk dies this is so sad good news is<SYNC Start=1200399><P class='en'>Elizabeth managed to unlock a power that<SYNC Start=1202529><P class='en'>can bring everyone dead back to life yes<SYNC Start=1205230><P class='en'>Elizabeth<SYNC Start=1205919><P class='en'>that ridiculous powerup of yours<SYNC Start=1207509><P class='en'>actually was not your fault it was<SYNC Start=1209789><P class='en'>because of the stupidly broken power of<SYNC Start=1211350><P class='en'>the anime villain net not only do we<SYNC Start=1213179><P class='en'>never see anyone else use this black<SYNC Start=1214950><P class='en'>snow powder thing again even though<SYNC Start=1216539><P class='en'>Hendrickson&#39;s power level at that point<SYNC Start=1218159><P class='en'>was like highballing 5000 and the demon<SYNC Start=1220710><P class='en'>Kang&#39;s is like five hundred thousand but<SYNC Start=1222960><P class='en'>Elizabeth never uses this revive from<SYNC Start=1224460><P class='en'>the dead thing go again either I mean<SYNC Start=1225960><P class='en'>you just can&#39;t win with stupid powers<SYNC
