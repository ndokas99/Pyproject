Start=4410><P class='en'>programmer and with me today I have my<SYNC Start=6960><P class='en'>good ol pal collide and today we&#39;re<SYNC Start=10260><P class='en'>gonna be talking about Ichigo versus the<SYNC Start=12090><P class='en'>Akatsuki now we&#39;re doing this video<SYNC Start=13860><P class='en'>because we need more bleach content on<SYNC Start=16020><P class='en'>the channel we have our magnum opus<SYNC Start=17430><P class='en'>coming in you know we&#39;re making Ichigo<SYNC Start=19710><P class='en'>vs. Naruto fully animated and all that<SYNC Start=21900><P class='en'>and it&#39;s a little bit weird that I&#39;ve<SYNC Start=23460><P class='en'>been binge reading and watching and all<SYNC Start=26189><P class='en'>of this stuff for Bleach and I haven&#39;t<SYNC Start=27840><P class='en'>made a single bleach related video<SYNC Start=29730><P class='en'>really since moderate vs. Aizen so I<SYNC Start=32430><P class='en'>decided to get the bleach guy you know<SYNC Start=34260><P class='en'>Clyde on here and how are you doing<SYNC Start=36270><P class='en'>today climb I&#39;m doing fantastic Jeff<SYNC Start=38640><P class='en'>thank you for having me on the channel<SYNC Start=39840><P class='en'>once again so sad that I have spent the<SYNC Start=41910><P class='en'>past good two or three days weary<SYNC Start=44610><P class='en'>watched a heap of the fights from Bleach<SYNC Start=46350><P class='en'>and also ran through them too so we can<SYNC Start=47910><P class='en'>see if we could find any sort of things<SYNC Start=49350><P class='en'>here and there South also found<SYNC Start=50730><P class='en'>something very interesting which I&#39;ll<SYNC Start=51870><P class='en'>talk about later on through the video<SYNC Start=53160><P class='en'>and that is a few data book related<SYNC Start=55379><P class='en'>things which bleach actually lacks if<SYNC Start=57210><P class='en'>you&#39;re a bleach fan you&#39;ll know that<SYNC Start=58260><P class='en'>it&#39;s quite hard to find a lot of our<SYNC Start=60090><P class='en'>feet and speed and DC related stuff for<SYNC Start=62250><P class='en'>Bleach because they just don&#39;t usually<SYNC Start=63449><P class='en'>give it to us but Seth did find some<SYNC Start=65220><P class='en'>very interesting data book related stuff<SYNC Start=66810><P class='en'>and thanks to his friend who speaks<SYNC Start=68070><P class='en'>fluent Japanese we were able to get a<SYNC Start=69810><P class='en'>translated so that&#39;s something to look<SYNC Start=71159><P class='en'>forward to with this video but I&#39;m super<SYNC Start=72600><P class='en'>happy to be on because we do have naruto<SYNC Start=74670><P class='en'>vs ichigo coming later on through the<SYNC Start=76320><P class='en'>year we&#39;re being hyping it up for almost<SYNC Start=77729><P class='en'>two whole years and yeah a little bit<SYNC Start=80460><P class='en'>longer than we thought but it will be<SYNC Start=81900><P class='en'>worth it guys so I hope this video as a<SYNC Start=83939><P class='en'>substitute for the time being because we<SYNC Start=85590><P class='en'>haven&#39;t done any bleach content so once<SYNC Start=87119><P class='en'>again thanks for having me on so as I<SYNC Start=88920><P class='en'>hinted at the beginning of the video<SYNC Start=90540><P class='en'>Clyde will be doing pretty much most of<SYNC Start=92640><P class='en'>the belief stuff and I will be doing<SYNC Start=94020><P class='en'>just about all of the Naruto stuff and<SYNC Start=96119><P class='en'>after we kind of could join our opinions<SYNC Start=98610><P class='en'>at the end then you&#39;ll hear the response<SYNC Start=100860><P class='en'>but for now we&#39;re gonna kind of go over<SYNC Start=102420><P class='en'>each of meta one-by-one we&#39;re only gonna<SYNC Start=104579><P class='en'>be going over a power and speed very<SYNC Start=106170><P class='en'>particularly right now but once we do<SYNC Start=108689><P class='en'>our outro after the stats are down we&#39;ll<SYNC Start=110880><P class='en'>talk more about hacks teamwork and<SYNC Start=113100><P class='en'>what&#39;s going to happen with the<SYNC Start=114180><P class='en'>characters so without further ado Clyde<SYNC Start=116130><P class='en'>take it away<SYNC Start=119350><P class='en'>to start off the scaling for each euro<SYNC Start=121450><P class='en'>I&#39;d like to dedicate the beginning of<SYNC Start=123070><P class='en'>this segment by quickly debunking two<SYNC Start=125350><P class='en'>things and the scaling of bleach that<SYNC Start=126820><P class='en'>have become quite outdated and doesn&#39;t<SYNC Start=129160><P class='en'>need to be used anymore when it comes to<SYNC Start=131110><P class='en'>having bleaching verses matchups it&#39;s<SYNC Start=132880><P class='en'>just really silly at this stage the<SYNC Start=134320><P class='en'>first of those being gains bankai in the<SYNC Start=136810><P class='en'>anime and manga of bleach gained spends<SYNC Start=139180><P class='en'>the entire fight of each go trolling him<SYNC Start=141370><P class='en'>while talking in code there&#39;s actually<SYNC Start=143200><P class='en'>an interesting moment where each guy<SYNC Start=144610><P class='en'>thinks he knows what gains bunk I can do<SYNC Start=146680><P class='en'>but gain distinctly saves to himself in<SYNC Start=148959><P class='en'>the monologue on the manga and in the<SYNC Start=151180><P class='en'>anime that he is impressed by a ichigo&#39;s<SYNC Start=153310><P class='en'>ability to come up with this hypothesis<SYNC Start=155200><P class='en'>from the few encounters with the bankai<SYNC Start=157000><P class='en'>though it is in fact incorrect many<SYNC Start=159340><P class='en'>people use this to downplay bleach<SYNC Start=161020><P class='en'>characters in speed 13 later tells eyes<SYNC Start=163480><P class='en'>and his sword isn&#39;t as fast as he said<SYNC Start=165459><P class='en'>nor is that even the swords main ability<SYNC Start=167830><P class='en'>surprisingly people completely forget<SYNC Start=170080><P class='en'>this game scene which blows my mind<SYNC Start=172030><P class='en'>because it happens during a very<SYNC Start=174280><P class='en'>important moment in the story it&#39;s<SYNC Start=176200><P class='en'>almost impossible to miss not only just<SYNC Start=178420><P class='en'>gain explicitly say that that&#39;s not how<SYNC Start=180310><P class='en'>his sword works but we&#39;ve seen better<SYNC Start=181840><P class='en'>speed feats back in the soul society arc<SYNC Start=183700><P class='en'>where each go can cut a majority of B<SYNC Start=185890><P class='en'>Aki is 100 million blades and blocks a<SYNC Start=188170><P class='en'>weapon that has the power of 3 million<SYNC Start=190840><P class='en'>zanpakuto when it is in the process of<SYNC Start=193180><P class='en'>executing an individual and let&#39;s be<SYNC Start=195010><P class='en'>real for a second Ichigo is a 15 year<SYNC Start=197829><P class='en'>old boy who only got his palace a few<SYNC Start=199750><P class='en'>months ago he went from being relative<SYNC Start=201670><P class='en'>to humans in speed to relative to<SYNC Start=204549><P class='en'>literal death gods in speed the same way<SYNC Start=207160><P class='en'>gains clapping analogy and presses the<SYNC Start=209049><P class='en'>average fan of bleach is the same way<SYNC Start=211299><P class='en'>that it impressed Ichigo<SYNC Start=213010><P class='en'>the other thing I&#39;d like to debunk<SYNC Start=214299><P class='en'>really quick is this scan here which is<SYNC Start=216489><P class='en'>from the Bleach official character book<SYNC Start=218380><P class='en'>code of souls like lightning each very<SYNC Start=221049><P class='en'>precious be Akio with godlike speed and<SYNC Start=223450><P class='en'>attacks him at close range the problem<SYNC Start=225790><P class='en'>with using this statement is that this<SYNC Start=227769><P class='en'>is the equivalent to some mythological<SYNC Start=229540><P class='en'>wording from folklore that we even<SYNC Start=231459><P class='en'>actually use in our real world<SYNC Start=232810><P class='en'>throughout history where you&#39;ll see<SYNC Start=234250><P class='en'>plenty of stories use phrases like<SYNC Start=235810><P class='en'>godlike lightning or heavenly power<SYNC Start=238750><P class='en'>things along those nature right you know<SYNC Start=240489><P class='en'>it&#39;s just there to sound impressive now<SYNC Start=242500><P class='en'>the reason why using that data books can<SYNC Start=244959><P class='en'>and especially the wording and taking it<SYNC Start=247090><P class='en'>very hyper literal the reason why it&#39;s<SYNC Start=248889><P class='en'>silly is because later on Bo<SYNC Start=251560><P class='en'>keya blocks the attacks as shown in the<SYNC Start=253780><P class='en'>data book itself right ambi akhiya then<SYNC Start=255790><P class='en'>doubles his own speed later on and still<SYNC Start=258220><P class='en'>can&#39;t catch each eager the reason they<SYNC Start=260169><P class='en'>attach words like godlike or lightning<SYNC Start=262360><P class='en'>or so on and so forth like I just talked<SYNC Start=264070><P class='en'>about before with actual IRL folklore is<SYNC Start=266650><P class='en'>because it&#39;s meant to be impressive and<SYNC Start=268210><P class='en'>this is the first showing of ichigo&#39;s<SYNC Start=270010><P class='en'>bankai on top of this the lieutenants<SYNC Start=272410><P class='en'>and captains themselves actually show<SYNC Start=274810><P class='en'>better feats and for Ichigo to be only<SYNC Start=276730><P class='en'>seen as lightning speed when byakuya<SYNC Start=278950><P class='en'>actually complements the speed of his<SYNC Start=280600><P class='en'>bankai would be just a tad ridiculous<SYNC Start=282790><P class='en'>surprisingly enough though light speed<SYNC Start=285040><P class='en'>is actually the most consistent thing in<SYNC Start=287050><P class='en'>the story of bleach as even shuhei<SYNC Start=288910><P class='en'>hisagi is shown being able to dodge the<SYNC Start=291070><P class='en'>nagashi on a beam of light used to<SYNC Start=293169><P class='en'>actually save hollows meaning it spits<SYNC Start=295120><P class='en'>it out of the sky as fast as possible to<SYNC Start=297520><P class='en'>transport them back to hueco mundo if<SYNC Start=299530><P class='en'>they&#39;re in danger and is constantly<SYNC Start=301360><P class='en'>referred to as light by even the head<SYNC Start=303639><P class='en'>captain who dismissively tells them not<SYNC Start=306250><P class='en'>to bother trying to stop eyes and now<SYNC Start=307870><P class='en'>after it covers gain Tosun and himself<SYNC Start=310240><P class='en'>no no Issei is also able to tag x-axis<SYNC Start=313300><P class='en'>as light and refers to the attacks as<SYNC Start=315190><P class='en'>light multiple times throughout the<SYNC Start=316870><P class='en'>actual fears translations yet she has no<SYNC Start=319120><P class='en'>son poked her of her own and is probably<SYNC Start=321430><P class='en'>weaker than the likes of Zeno soos gate<SYNC Start=323890><P class='en'>Kermit Donny before she gets her royal<SYNC Start=325810><P class='en'>family weapon and she is without a doubt<SYNC Start=327640><P class='en'>weaker than the likes of Shi Kai each<SYNC Start=329620><P class='en'>year from the soul society our crew has<SYNC Start=331390><P class='en'>the power of around 3 million fodder<SYNC Start=333550><P class='en'>saarebas as said before alongside the<SYNC Start=336220><P class='en'>fact that Orihime can even react to you<SYNC Start=338770><P class='en'>heart attacks and block them she was<SYNC Start=340720><P class='en'>also shown in the hueco mundo art being<SYNC Start=342490><P class='en'>able to tag someone who euros attacks<SYNC Start=344229><P class='en'>when he was trying to hurt Ichigo and<SYNC Start=345789><P class='en'>what&#39;s interesting about some of the<SYNC Start=347020><P class='en'>things that she blocks is that these are<SYNC Start=348580><P class='en'>attacks that are actually too fast for<SYNC Start=350229><P class='en'>Ichigo to move out of the way this is<SYNC Start=352090><P class='en'>the same Ichigo who could blitz Quincy<SYNC Start=354220><P class='en'>girls who were leagues above little<SYNC Start=355840><P class='en'>turtle um pod and she was shown being<SYNC Start=357880><P class='en'>able to use hidden kalkaluru to flash<SYNC Start=359650><P class='en'>over push another quincy out of the way<SYNC Start=362110><P class='en'>and dodged the australian light the<SYNC Start=364060><P class='en'>australian light is actually so fast<SYNC Start=366190><P class='en'>that pretty much every single Quincy<SYNC Start=368229><P class='en'>that it was aimed at was actually hit by<SYNC Start=370210><P class='en'>the light itself even Busbee couldn&#39;t<SYNC Start=372460><P class='en'>dodge delight and he was comparable to<SYNC Start=374080><P class='en'>Shi Kai Yamamoto bankai Renji and even<SYNC Start=377320><P class='en'>made Toshiro run away he also blitzed<SYNC Start=379780><P class='en'>the same Quincy girls Ichigo was<SYNC Start=381700><P class='en'>fighting by a one shotting every<SYNC Start=383729><P class='en'>single one of them and these are the<SYNC Start=385259><P class='en'>same girls that were giving kampachi<SYNC Start=386849><P class='en'>trouble after his fight with Gremmie<SYNC Start=388680><P class='en'>to put it simple any sorry far around<SYNC Start=390719><P class='en'>the rank of code lieutenant level is<SYNC Start=392610><P class='en'>most likely FTL quite casually and this<SYNC Start=395249><P class='en'>is pretty crazy considering the null<SYNC Start=396960><P class='en'>chad and orihime are able to perceive<SYNC Start=399569><P class='en'>movements from characters who are far<SYNC Start=401219><P class='en'>above them and massively faster than<SYNC Start=403409><P class='en'>light<SYNC Start=403860><P class='en'>now as for Ichigo speed however said<SYNC Start=406259><P class='en'>that I will talk about that at the end<SYNC Start=407550><P class='en'>of the video alongside many other FTL<SYNC Start=410189><P class='en'>feats that you guys have definitely<SYNC Start=411629><P class='en'>never heard of to go over the akatsuki<SYNC Start=417300><P class='en'>speed the speed of Naruto is<SYNC Start=419009><P class='en'>ever-evolving and honestly can have its<SYNC Start=421050><P class='en'>own 30-minute video and still be missing<SYNC Start=422969><P class='en'>some parts to it and since we have a lot<SYNC Start=425039><P class='en'>of things to go over I&#39;m gonna keep this<SYNC Start=426719><P class='en'>as brief as possible since we&#39;re<SYNC Start=428069><P class='en'>probably gonna go into more detail after<SYNC Start=429479><P class='en'>we talk about the stats there are three<SYNC Start=431969><P class='en'>metas to naruto speed one is that<SYNC Start=434339><P class='en'>lightning timing is considered top-tier<SYNC Start=436649><P class='en'>in the verse for joaneen Kakashi is a<SYNC Start=438930><P class='en'>legend for cutting a lightning bolt here<SYNC Start=440969><P class='en'>and is considered insanely fast by black<SYNC Start=443159><P class='en'>zetsu who literally made the shinobi<SYNC Start=445379><P class='en'>world and the fourth red COG a stated to<SYNC Start=447659><P class='en'>have lightning-fast attacks in the data<SYNC Start=449789><P class='en'>book - is the relativistic to light meta<SYNC Start=452999><P class='en'>which is even if the fourth right cog a<SYNC Start=455370><P class='en'>was low-balled to lightning speed Minato<SYNC Start=457919><P class='en'>KCM Naruto and other characters are able<SYNC Start=460770><P class='en'>to blitz him by dozens of times<SYNC Start=463560><P class='en'>he&#39;s usually reach a few percentages of<SYNC Start=465959><P class='en'>the speed of light due to such and this<SYNC Start=467639><P class='en'>is usually accompanied by a ton of<SYNC Start=469349><P class='en'>calculations and pixel scaling and so on<SYNC Start=471990><P class='en'>the third is the Lightspeed meta in<SYNC Start=474659><P class='en'>which you could point to many things in<SYNC Start=476550><P class='en'>Naruto most specifically the data books<SYNC Start=479099><P class='en'>that reference things as light such as<SYNC Start=480509><P class='en'>Mifune is bijou cloak slashes Haku zeiss<SYNC Start=483599><P class='en'>mirrors Dara&#39;s laser circus which<SYNC Start=485819><P class='en'>refracts off of water particles like<SYNC Start=487770><P class='en'>light and even the right car gaze larrya<SYNC Start=489779><P class='en'>is described like light although it<SYNC Start=491819><P class='en'>questionably contradicts the previous<SYNC Start=493589><P class='en'>lightening statement you could make<SYNC Start=495240><P class='en'>arguments that the light meta<SYNC Start=496469><P class='en'>contradicts a few things such as Kakashi<SYNC Start=498389><P class='en'>and the war getting blitz by a<SYNC Start=499709><P class='en'>supposedly light speed Haku even though<SYNC Start=502229><P class='en'>he should be able to keep up with a much<SYNC Start=504149><P class='en'>faster than light Naruto using kauke&#39;s<SYNC Start=506490><P class='en'>however these aren&#39;t important for this<SYNC Start=508110><P class='en'>video for now we&#39;ll just give everyone<SYNC Start=509490><P class='en'>to benefit from the doubt and say that<SYNC Start=510870><P class='en'>the Akatsuki who scale pretty<SYNC Start=512250><P class='en'>prominently to Kakashi stage Naruto and<SYNC Start=515039><P class='en'>so forth would reach most of any of<SYNC Start=516930><P class='en'>these<SYNC Start=517200><P class='en'>metas at least in reaction or combat<SYNC Start=519060><P class='en'>speed as sage mode is described by<SYNC Start=521190><P class='en'>Naruto himself as being faster than KCM<SYNC Start=524039><P class='en'>in reaction speeds with pain and obito<SYNC Start=526440><P class='en'>being able to fight them and the last<SYNC Start=527940><P class='en'>time Naruto fought when sage mode was<SYNC Start=530160><P class='en'>versus the night tails and versus pain<SYNC Start=533420><P class='en'>when talking about ichigo&#39;s destructive<SYNC Start=536040><P class='en'>capacity or attack potency it&#39;s honestly<SYNC Start=538200><P class='en'>quite straightforward and simple hueco<SYNC Start=540210><P class='en'>mundo Ichigo after his battle with<SYNC Start=541950><P class='en'>Grimmjow actually fights quite well<SYNC Start=543750><P class='en'>against kruky aura this is the same<SYNC Start=545430><P class='en'>earth you&#39;re her Grimmjow didn&#39;t want to<SYNC Start=547170><P class='en'>fight to the point where he actually put<SYNC Start=548730><P class='en'>him in a different dimension using the<SYNC Start=550350><P class='en'>caja nagashi on now to do this in short<SYNC Start=552840><P class='en'>every go Sparta is said to be able to<SYNC Start=554610><P class='en'>destroy it lost no chairs with a cron<SYNC Start=556170><P class='en'>race arrow this is a rule set by Aizen<SYNC Start=558480><P class='en'>and directly stated by aruki aura Sasuke<SYNC Start=560730><P class='en'>Aizen being the one from a society of<SYNC Start=562860><P class='en'>1000 plus year-old super geniuses that<SYNC Start=565200><P class='en'>are actually so intelligent that they<SYNC Start=566790><P class='en'>can manipulate reality and life itself<SYNC Start=568650><P class='en'>these thousand-year-old<SYNC Start=570450><P class='en'>entities would be more than capable to<SYNC Start=572460><P class='en'>be able to calculate reiatsu in basic<SYNC Start=574350><P class='en'>physics when it comes to their own power<SYNC Start=575790><P class='en'>Aizen was even able to calculate the<SYNC Start=578490><P class='en'>exact percentage of how weak his crew he<SYNC Start=581100><P class='en'>so he was compared to what it could be<SYNC Start=582900><P class='en'>at its match potential Holly Bell struck<SYNC Start=585030><P class='en'>Sione even comment that grim Jia<SYNC Start=586980><P class='en'>shouldn&#39;t have released his grundrisse<SYNC Start=588330><P class='en'>arrow against Ichigo while in his base<SYNC Start=590370><P class='en'>form and Ichigo then goes on to fight<SYNC Start=592650><P class='en'>rim jaw in his release state where his<SYNC Start=594540><P class='en'>power and speed increases 5 to 10 times<SYNC Start=596820><P class='en'>as our horror compares them to bankai<SYNC Start=599010><P class='en'>and strength and the Espada&#39;s themselves<SYNC Start=600930><P class='en'>alongside their sword cement anemic soul<SYNC Start=602910><P class='en'>reapers and tight a coup bro describes<SYNC Start=604950><P class='en'>them as a hollow parallel Buki auras<SYNC Start=607290><P class='en'>base is then comparable to an Ichiro<SYNC Start=609480><P class='en'>that&#39;s even stronger than this scrim gl<SYNC Start=611040><P class='en'>as Aizen states that he masters his hala<SYNC Start=613200><P class='en'>fication in this fight meaning earth ura<SYNC Start=615090><P class='en'>is without a doubt as strong as released<SYNC Start=617040><P class='en'>grim gel now Kuro should easily be this<SYNC Start=619530><P class='en'>strong meaning he can destroy a lost no<SYNC Start=621120><P class='en'>chairs 5 to 10 times over in his base<SYNC Start=623340><P class='en'>form and if he uses his own run racer in<SYNC Start=626100><P class='en'>base this could mean that he could have<SYNC Start=627510><P class='en'>a several times increase in strength<SYNC Start=629310><P class='en'>according to the data book which Seth<SYNC Start=631080><P class='en'>actually found and translated himself it<SYNC Start=633360><P class='en'>should also be noted that Grimmjow in<SYNC Start=635190><P class='en'>his release Sayed actually has a tax<SYNC Start=637020><P class='en'>that surpassed his own gran racer which<SYNC Start=639000><P class='en'>he could use in his release state yet<SYNC Start=640830><P class='en'>Ichigo is able to handle these<SYNC Start=642600><P class='en'>tax and seems to be still relative to<SYNC Start=644670><P class='en'>each euro so this is how it works<SYNC Start=646649><P class='en'>euros base is five to ten times on snow<SYNC Start=648930><P class='en'>chairs and destructive capacity times<SYNC Start=650550><P class='en'>five to ten once again on top of that<SYNC Start=652649><P class='en'>with his first release then another five<SYNC Start=655079><P class='en'>three ten times on top of that with his<SYNC Start=656730><P class='en'>second release and if lost no chairs is<SYNC Start=659220><P class='en'>comparable to taxes Thailand and even a<SYNC Start=661800><P class='en'>percentage of say Australia which is a<SYNC Start=664050><P class='en'>conclusion most reach whether it&#39;s the<SYNC Start=666180><P class='en'>scaling of ScrewAttack or even back when<SYNC Start=668040><P class='en'>Seth and I rushed out motto reverses<SYNC Start=670230><P class='en'>isin video within the span of three days<SYNC Start=671759><P class='en'>or just you know goofy power scaling<SYNC Start=674040><P class='en'>forums here and they&#39;re all over the<SYNC Start=675149><P class='en'>internet they all come to a similar and<SYNC Start=677880><P class='en'>song so if we use Texas and Akira is one<SYNC Start=681509><P class='en'>thousand times his base in his second<SYNC Start=683610><P class='en'>release he could easily destroy an area<SYNC Start=685680><P class='en'>of 695 million square kilometers this is<SYNC Start=690329><P class='en'>a very layman way to do it but it works<SYNC Start=692399><P class='en'>now faster loading Ichigo absolutely<SYNC Start=695300><P class='en'>stomps this second release earth Yura<SYNC Start=697769><P class='en'>and thanks to SEFs research we found out<SYNC Start=699899><P class='en'>that the vast oh lordy has to be at<SYNC Start=701759><P class='en'>least ten times stronger than you are<SYNC Start=703529><P class='en'>because Akira can counter one of its<SYNC Start=705600><P class='en'>normal sorrows which Center or school<SYNC Start=707370><P class='en'>does this is the only reason you are a<SYNC Start=709800><P class='en'>even had a chance in the fight because<SYNC Start=711389><P class='en'>the data books directly state that<SYNC Start=713130><P class='en'>setter or Skoda&#39;s increases its attack<SYNC Start=714990><P class='en'>by an order of magnitude orders of<SYNC Start=717240><P class='en'>magnitude in physics and so forth being<SYNC Start=719490><P class='en'>in order of ten therefore it has to be<SYNC Start=721920><P class='en'>at least ten times greater than its<SYNC Start=723269><P class='en'>normal power this is consistent<SYNC Start=724860><P class='en'>considering grand race arrow which is<SYNC Start=726839><P class='en'>stated to be several times great off<SYNC Start=728519><P class='en'>several being times three and Akira<SYNC Start=730680><P class='en'>introduces his London over lumbago and<SYNC Start=732630><P class='en'>cetera Skouras as if they are more<SYNC Start=734550><P class='en'>impressive in conclusion the Vasto Lorde<SYNC Start=736709><P class='en'>a can easily destroy an area ten times<SYNC Start=738660><P class='en'>that of the earth Yura calc which would<SYNC Start=740579><P class='en'>be six billion nine hundred million<SYNC Start=743519><P class='en'>square kilometers this also isn&#39;t even<SYNC Start=745920><P class='en'>his max strength because the Vasto Lorde<SYNC Start=747870><P class='en'>a wasn&#39;t even at full power when he<SYNC Start=749399><P class='en'>fought her fury didn&#39;t use its own drum<SYNC Start=751500><P class='en'>race arrow and it was easily able to<SYNC Start=753779><P class='en'>crush and negate the lumps in Overland<SYNC Start=756149><P class='en'>Park which our hero decides to use after<SYNC Start=758850><P class='en'>his Center or schoolers release arrows<SYNC Start=760649><P class='en'>and blacks arrows fail<SYNC Start=762240><P class='en'>meaning it&#39;s obviously a stronger<SYNC Start=764040><P class='en'>technique as I said before if we do<SYNC Start=766110><P class='en'>include the fact that Ichigo can easily<SYNC Start=768060><P class='en'>counter the Lanza door alone Parker<SYNC

and he uses<SYNC Start=776519><P class='en'>his own run race error he is without a<SYNC Start=779339><P class='en'>doubt ten times six billion nine hundred<SYNC Start=782820><P class='en'>million

class='en'>kilometers<SYNC Start=790950><P class='en'>this isn&#39;t wank either because the whole<SYNC Start=792930><P class='en'>verse movie even comments on how his<SYNC Start=794820><P class='en'>normal Saros that covered multiple<SYNC Start=796680><P class='en'>layers of hell and blew open the doors<SYNC Start=798870><P class='en'>of hell would inadvertently have an<SYNC

who<SYNC Start=807180><P class='en'>he himself can threaten all of these<SYNC Start=809070><P class='en'>soul society while suppressed in the war<SYNC Start=811769><P class='en'>which is actually a parallel world to<SYNC Start=814140><P class='en'>the world of the living for destructive<SYNC Start=817050><P class='en'>capacity or attack potency most<SYNC Start=819269><P class='en'>calculations for the Akatsuki and their<SYNC Start=821130><P class='en'>strongest jutsu tend to hit 10 to the 21<SYNC Start=824070><P class='en'>joules which is usually considered<SYNC Start=826380><P class='en'>enough to destroy small countries in<SYNC Start=828600><P class='en'>terms of raw energy output and many of<SYNC Start=830760><P class='en'>those are high bald like dataries z0<SYNC

they&#39;ll also<SYNC Start=839070><P class='en'>add that that shockwave is actually how<SYNC Start=841410><P class='en'>much it vaporizes to be generous some<SYNC Start=843839><P class='en'>cows even go balls to the wall place<SYNC Start=846149><P class='en'>pains to Baku Tensei at over 10 to the<SYNC Start=848370><P class='en'>23 joules in place pains ship Baku<SYNC Start=851040><P

Start=856500><P class='en'>other than this you have to make a lot<SYNC Start=858480><P class='en'>of scaling assumptions to really get<SYNC Start=860250><P class='en'>them higher like finding ways to scale<SYNC Start=861930><P class='en'>the caste of the later war are<SYNC Start=863310><P class='en'>characters like the ninetails who stated<SYNC Start=865110><P class='en'>to be a threat to the entire planet<SYNC Start=866640><P class='en'>numerous times in the data book however<SYNC Start=868740><P class='en'>this is really work in a lot of<SYNC Start=870180><P class='en'>instances and the ninetails tends to<SYNC Start=871890><P class='en'>dominate any Akatsuki member comes<SYNC Start=873750><P class='en'>across including the Chewbacca Tensei as<SYNC Start=875730><P class='en'>well as the fact that stronger attacks<SYNC Start=877500><P class='en'>like the c0 is tinct by Magda&#39;s body the<SYNC Start=880079><P class='en'>sage snake who is rivaling more so a few<SYNC Start=882329><P class='en'>tails at the version to nine-tailed<SYNC Start=884010><P class='en'>cloak using Orochimaru rather than the<SYNC Start=886019><P class='en'>actual full-blooded knight tales at the<SYNC Start=888420><P class='en'>absolute best you might be able to get<SYNC Start=890130><P class='en'>them to scale to killer B who in his<SYNC Start=891899><P class='en'>eight tails state could sum out fight<SYNC Start=893459><P class='en'>against the incomplete 10 tails however<SYNC Start=895560><P class='en'>it&#39;s hard to say exactly how strong it<SYNC Start=897660><P class='en'>was as gnar still had an even bully<SYNC Start=899339><P class='en'>mastered his link with Kurama it was<SYNC Start=901140><P class='en'>constantly low on stamina for a lot of<SYNC Start=903209><P class='en'>that encounter giving the benefit<SYNC Start=904930><P class='en'>now you could say that the eight-tails<SYNC Start=906160><P class='en'>might be able to rival the multi<SYNC Start=907569><P class='en'>continental attacks of the tenth tale<SYNC Start=909040><P class='en'>that it could poop out although we&#39;ve<SYNC Start=910389><P class='en'>all seen how in reality the ten tails<SYNC Start=912490><P class='en'>can kind of flick away anything the<SYNC Start=914709><P class='en'>eight tails can actually do and even<SYNC Start=916449><P class='en'>then it&#39;s hard to scale the Akatsuki to<SYNC Start=918220><P class='en'>killer B anyway as even kisame who<SYNC Start=920259><P class='en'>actually fought him one of the stronger<SYNC Start=921790><P class='en'>members never actually took on a<SYNC Start=923709><P class='en'>full-powered b and was constantly<SYNC Start=925779><P class='en'>draining his power from him which would<SYNC Start=927910><P class='en'>have made the gap close even further<SYNC Start=929619><P class='en'>which would be more so an amped kisame<SYNC Start=931779><P class='en'>if anything at best you might be able to<SYNC Start=934209><P class='en'>say<SYNC Start=934509><P class='en'>Obito might scale to the night tails<SYNC Start=936339><P class='en'>since he could control it with his eyes<SYNC Start=938350><P class='en'>when he was like 14 and that Minato<SYNC Start=940329><P class='en'>thought that Naruto would need the night<SYNC Start=943149><P class='en'>tails mastery and even then it might be<SYNC Start=945160><P class='en'>questionable if he stands a chance all<SYNC Start=948429><P class='en'>right fellas so I hope this HG reverses<SYNC Start=950499><P class='en'>the Akatsuki video has lived up to its<SYNC Start=952749><P class='en'>expectations we&#39;re being hyping it up<SYNC Start=954579><P class='en'>for quite a while took a very long time<SYNC Start=956110><P class='en'>to our make but it has been worth the<SYNC Start=958869><P class='en'>long wait itself Seth do you want to<SYNC Start=960490><P class='en'>give them a general rundown of how this<SYNC Start=961899><P class='en'>fight would actually go down because<SYNC Start=962920><P class='en'>we&#39;ve covered everything to do with the<SYNC Start=964149><P class='en'>Ecosse and Ichigo but how about the<SYNC Start=965740><P class='en'>fight actually guard after the pole will<SYNC Start=967929><P class='en'>break down to beat a and we briefly went<SYNC Start=969339><P class='en'>over everything and look look how long<SYNC Start=971110><P class='en'>the videos been and we still have so<SYNC Start=973120><P class='en'>much more to go over so even with this<SYNC Start=975160><P class='en'>outro we&#39;re still not gonna be able to<SYNC Start=976480><P class='en'>go over everything so we&#39;re probably<SYNC Start=977829><P class='en'>gonna be making more Naruto versus<SYNC Start=979240><P class='en'>Bleach diverse content in the future to<SYNC Start=981100><P class='en'>kind of go over more details but for now<SYNC Start=982689><P class='en'>I&#39;ll keep it brief stats and speed<SYNC Start=984339><P class='en'>comparison speed wise it&#39;s pretty it&#39;s<SYNC Start=987069><P class='en'>pretty contentious it&#39;s like you could<SYNC Start=988990><P class='en'>argue both of these forces are reaching<SYNC Start=991480><P class='en'>a similar 10 to the 21 joules of<SYNC Start=994149><P class='en'>destructive output or attack potency at<SYNC Start=996249><P class='en'>their strongest or maybe more so higher<SYNC Start=999189><P class='en'>for Ichigo especially using those okey<SYNC Start=1001410><P class='en'>doke Alex that Clyde presented earlier<SYNC Start=1003540><P class='en'>and it really should be noted that most<SYNC Start=1006300><P class='en'>of these attacks by the Akatsuki that do<SYNC Start=1008850><P class='en'>reach these country quote-unquote as the<SYNC Start=1011220><P class='en'>versus community would like to label<SYNC Start=1012569><P class='en'>that it usually requires most of their<SYNC Start=1014879><P class='en'>more powerful attacks like Daedra<SYNC Start=1016949><P class='en'>literally committing suicide pain giving<SYNC Start=1020100><P class='en'>himself like a brain hemorrhage while he<SYNC Start=1022980><P class='en'>tries to like hold down the night tails<SYNC Start=1024959><P class='en'>with this Chewbacca 10 say the Susanoo<SYNC Start=1027058><P class='en'>ripping Itachi&#39;s body apart things like<SYNC Start=1029428><P class='en'>that it&#39;s not necessarily casual whereas<SYNC Start=1031319><P class='en'>with Ichigo he&#39;s just doing it with<SYNC Start=1033058><P class='en'>every single attack he throws like a<SYNC Start=1034589><P class='en'>damn Dragon Ball character in speed like<SYNC Start=1037048><P class='en'>I said before it depends on what<SYNC Start=1038670><P class='en'>Mehta you&#39;re using and you really really<SYNC Start=1040530><P class='en'>have to give them both the benefit of<SYNC Start=1042839><P class='en'>the doubt for them to reach those 10<SYNC Start=1044339><P class='en'>through 100 times the speed of light<SYNC Start=1045870><P class='en'>ranges but they do bulk tend to reach<SYNC Start=1048569><P class='en'>near those areas if you hai bought the<SYNC Start=1050670><P class='en'>Akatsuki and you really give them the<SYNC Start=1052140><P class='en'>method now it&#39;s actually easier than it<SYNC Start=1053700><P class='en'>is for Ichigo because each go requires<SYNC Start=1055470><P class='en'>more assumptions however the power<SYNC Start=1057750><P class='en'>difference is still there and obviously<SYNC Start=1059700><P class='en'>attack range and stamina goes in<SYNC Start=1062010><P class='en'>ichigo&#39;s favor Ichigo has enough stamina<SYNC Start=1063450><P class='en'>to fight for months on end without<SYNC Start=1065220><P class='en'>stopping rest the Akatsuki their<SYNC Start=1067020><P class='en'>strongest attacks defy ichigo with their<SYNC Start=1069060><P class='en'>really not doing a whole lot so it<SYNC Start=1071100><P class='en'>doesn&#39;t really matter even if you did<SYNC Start=1072570><P class='en'>wank off the akatsuki speed in that area<SYNC Start=1075090><P class='en'>now as I mentioned earlier the hell<SYNC Start=1076800><P class='en'>verse stuff is actually very important<SYNC Start=1078540><P class='en'>for this video because it really slaps<SYNC Start=1080070><P class='en'>into people&#39;s faces that the Vasto Lorde<SYNC Start=1082290><P class='en'>8 is planet level and Kubo takes things<SYNC Start=1084810><P class='en'>from the filler the movies and it kind<SYNC Start=1087150><P class='en'>of works in the same way when it comes<SYNC Start=1088830><P class='en'>to canonicity as dragon ball does where<SYNC Start=1091020><P class='en'>toe a and p rot have sort of an<SYNC Start=1092670><P class='en'>influence over bleach and dragon bolt<SYNC Start=1094500><P class='en'>they can sort of add things into the<SYNC Start=1095790><P class='en'>story with the movies crew bo approves<SYNC Start=1097170><P class='en'>them if you just like some stuff he&#39;ll<SYNC Start=1098460><P class='en'>maybe comment on them here and there<SYNC Start=1099900><P class='en'>which is i think people are gonna bring<SYNC Start=1101160><P class='en'>up when it comes to how verse movie but<SYNC Start=1102630><P class='en'>he is directly credited in the opening<SYNC Start=1104490><P class='en'>and the actual cover of the movie itself<SYNC Start=1106410><P class='en'>so we have no reason to distrust that<SYNC Start=1108030><P class='en'>and considering the fact that he does<SYNC Start=1109290><P class='en'>use stuff directly from the filler and<SYNC Start=1111240><P class='en'>the actual movie 1 and puts it into the<SYNC Start=1113550><P class='en'>manga it&#39;s like well it&#39;s not only<SYNC Start=1115590><P class='en'>muster dispute here is there sir you<SYNC Start=1117180><P class='en'>have yamamoto confirming his planet<SYNC Start=1118770><P class='en'>level ichigo is anywhere from 10 through<SYNC Start=1120540><P class='en'>a hundred times the speed of light he&#39;s<SYNC Start=1122490><P class='en'>easily you know as i said planet level<SYNC Start=1123960><P class='en'>once again not looking too good and<SYNC Start=1125670><P class='en'>that&#39;s pretty much in for the Canon of<SYNC Start=1127680><P class='en'>the movie itself yeah so Canon is a very<SYNC Start=1130770><P class='en'>subjective in broad area of debate and<SYNC Start=1134820><P class='en'>once again could have its own video but<SYNC Start=1136740><P class='en'>in this case Canon is just more so can<SYNC Start=1139470><P class='en'>it be used during the discussion there<SYNC Start=1141330><P class='en'>are obviously like particular<SYNC Start=1142950><P class='en'>definitions of Canon which this wouldn&#39;t<SYNC Start=1144600><P class='en'>apply to however in this case it does<SYNC Start=1146610><P class='en'>apply I do believe and as Clyde<SYNC Start=1148380><P class='en'>described now the reason we bring this<SYNC Start=1150150><P class='en'>up is obviously Ichigo himself in that<SYNC Start=1152250><P class='en'>movie actually thought that his hollow<SYNC Start=1154080><P class='en'>form was enough to destroy the whole<SYNC Start=1156090><P class='en'>world<SYNC Start=1156630><P class='en'>and Yamamoto actually credits Ichigo for<SYNC Start=1159360><P class='en'>cutting something that everyone thought<SYNC Start=1161160><P class='en'>was uncuttable yamamoto being a being<SYNC Start=1163590><P class='en'>who&#39;s so powerful he can destroy the<SYNC Start=1165900><P class='en'>planet by standing there believes they<SYNC Start=1167970><P class='en'>were uncuttable as well so that is also<SYNC Start=1170070><P class='en'>something to think about now even<SYNC Start=1172169><P class='en'>you do just say like maybe that&#39;s too<SYNC Start=1174299><P class='en'>big and Ichigo does get offed there&#39;s<SYNC Start=1176340><P class='en'>obviously the war arced Ichigo which his<SYNC Start=1178919><P class='en'>base form is rivaling his vast Oh Lord a<SYNC Start=1182039><P class='en'>state pretty casually at least in the<SYNC Start=1183600><P class='en'>statement of you ha and then he can<SYNC Start=1185070><P class='en'>multiply all his stats by over 30 times<SYNC Start=1187529><P class='en'>using a bankai which is ten times him<SYNC Start=1189629><P class='en'>but obviously his several-fold<SYNC Start=1190710><P class='en'>multiplier of his grand race arrows and<SYNC Start=1192450><P class='en'>then obviously his speed would go up by<SYNC Start=1194129><P class='en'>ten times as well and there&#39;s just<SYNC Start=1195629><P class='en'>really no way for the Akatsuki to reach<SYNC Start=1197489><P class='en'>those levels if it was more arc and you<SYNC Start=1199169><P class='en'>would really have to just deny ichigo&#39;s<SYNC Start=1201269><P class='en'>Vasto Lorde a lor now other than that<SYNC Start=1203039><P class='en'>there are hacks the Akatsuki have like<SYNC Start=1205739><P class='en'>sasori&#39;s poison which I will hand over<SYNC Start=1208019><P class='en'>to Clyde for that one now I know a lot<SYNC Start=1209759><P class='en'>of Naruto fans are gonna bring up the<SYNC Start=1211200><P class='en'>idea that well if they work as a quote<SYNC Start=1212999><P class='en'>team with all the we&#39;ve all heard the<SYNC Start=1214919><P class='en'>meme of you know the teamwork stuff they<SYNC Start=1216720><P class='en'>could probably poison Ichigo and then he<SYNC Start=1218429><P class='en'>just gets named from that because<SYNC Start=1219779><P class='en'>there&#39;s nothing he can do well sadly<SYNC Start=1221220><P class='en'>when Seth and I went through bleach once<SYNC Start=1222960><P class='en'>again we noticed that up if you have<SYNC Start=1224519><P class='en'>high enough we&#39;re out so you can negate<SYNC Start=1226049><P class='en'>poisons because Yami does it to a frosty<SYNC Start=1228239><P class='en'>owner who covers his body with this<SYNC Start=1229739><P class='en'>poison that can actually a road a<SYNC Start=1231119><P class='en'>concrete also Ichigo is able to fight<SYNC Start=1233700><P class='en'>against gain who gains bankai it stated<SYNC Start=1235859><P class='en'>that his actual poison can erode cells<SYNC Start=1238440><P class='en'>when he gets clipped by the bankai<SYNC Start=1240149><P class='en'>itself he explains his two eyes and by<SYNC Start=1241649><P class='en'>each go does get stabbed by the bankai<SYNC Start=1243149><P class='en'>and yet he doesn&#39;t take any damage from<SYNC Start=1244710><P class='en'>the poison so it&#39;s not looking too good<SYNC Start=1246929><P class='en'>when it comes to that so I wouldn&#39;t have<SYNC Start=1248279><P class='en'>too much confidence in poison if I were<SYNC Start=1249840><P class='en'>you guys personally I don&#39;t believe that<SYNC Start=1251519><P class='en'>game&#39;s poison touched Ichigo but that is<SYNC Start=1253799><P class='en'>something to consider that it might have<SYNC Start=1255749><P class='en'>raised him when it went by but the<SYNC Start=1257549><P class='en'>fractions poison being so strong it<SYNC Start=1260009><P class='en'>dissolves concrete is a little bit<SYNC Start=1262019><P class='en'>different than salary&#39;s poison which<SYNC Start=1263669><P class='en'>probably just attacks like via proteins<SYNC Start=1265679><P class='en'>in the body I mean if they could tank<SYNC Start=1267570><P class='en'>that much more potent physical poison I<SYNC Start=1270600><P class='en'>don&#39;t really see any evidence that<SYNC Start=1271830><P class='en'>acessories work now other than that<SYNC Start=1274139><P class='en'>there is data receive alms<SYNC Start=1276869><P class='en'>now in this debate we are obviously<SYNC Start=1278850><P class='en'>saying okay the Akatsuki can see Ichigo<SYNC Start=1281249><P class='en'>otherwise they&#39;re fighting a an<SYNC Start=1282629><P class='en'>invisible spirit man that they don&#39;t<SYNC Start=1284789><P class='en'>even know exists now you could say that<SYNC Start=1286769><P class='en'>chakra is spiritual in nature and<SYNC Start=1289259><P class='en'>therefore they can sense Ichigo however<SYNC Start=1291659><P class='en'>if you grant that benefit of the doubt<SYNC Start=1293399><P class='en'>to the Akatsuki then Ichigo can see<SYNC Start=1295259><P class='en'>chakra because chakra is spiritual in<SYNC Start=1297029><P class='en'>nature as well if you&#39;re linking one<SYNC Start=1298799><P class='en'>thing yet the link the other and in this<SYNC Start=1300359><P class='en'>case Ichigo would be able to see the<SYNC Start=1302009><P class='en'>bombs and then there&#39;s even the argument<SYNC Start=1303749><P class='en'>whether it effect each go regardless<SYNC Start=1305510><P class='en'>I mean it didn&#39;t even rip apart Mondas<SYNC Start=1307190><P class='en'>body and Monda is considered weaker than<SYNC Start=1309560><P class='en'>Orochimaru if he had his arms and as<SYNC Start=1311600><P class='en'>well as the fact that Monda is in<SYNC Start=1314090><P class='en'>Orochimaru or more so rivaling Naruto<SYNC Start=1316430><P class='en'>with a few tales of diversion to nine<SYNC Start=1319040><P class='en'>tails cloak not anywhere close to the<SYNC Start=1321410><P class='en'>full thing so it&#39;s really once again<SYNC Start=1323000><P class='en'>hard to argue that they would do<SYNC Start=1324890><P class='en'>anything now next there&#39;s pain and zetsu<SYNC Start=1327200><P class='en'>now pain and zetsu and obito they do<SYNC Start=1329780><P class='en'>kind of scale to that late war era if<SYNC Start=1332060><P class='en'>you use the fact that pain was stealing<SYNC Start=1333800><P class='en'>away the nine tails there&#39;s more<SYNC Start=1335150><P class='en'>arguments than that but just keeping it<SYNC Start=1337070><P class='en'>brief he is able to maybe like hold down<SYNC Start=1339080><P class='en'>the eight tails of the nine tails which<SYNC Start=1340580><P class='en'>is pretty considerable since it&#39;s a<SYNC Start=1342050><P class='en'>planet Buster in its full state zetsu<SYNC Start=1344360><P class='en'>who was so powerful that he was able to<SYNC Start=1345950><P class='en'>amp Obito to fight late war Kakashi<SYNC Start=1348500><P class='en'>Minato and a lesser zetsu was able to<SYNC Start=1350990><P class='en'>hold off the whole shinobi alliance so<SYNC Start=1352970><P class='en'>these two characters once again even if<SYNC Start=1355040><P class='en'>they do beat master Lord a they&#39;re<SYNC Start=1356750><P class='en'>getting negged once again by war arc<SYNC Start=1359840><P class='en'>ichigo they do not have the same brow<SYNC Start=1362120><P class='en'>busting or speed feats to really compete<SYNC Start=1364820><P class='en'>with that unfortunately next is Itachi&#39;s<SYNC Start=1367310><P class='en'>genjutsu Itachi&#39;s genjutsu unfortunately<SYNC Start=1370220><P class='en'>while it may work on a jinchuriki as<SYNC Start=1374060><P class='en'>implied by Naruto with his tsukuyomi at<SYNC Start=1376730><P class='en'>least there&#39;s no evidence that it would<SYNC Start=1378440><P class='en'>work on Ichigo who has two spirits and<SYNC Start=1380780><P class='en'>both of those spirits are more than<SYNC Start=1382640><P class='en'>likely more powerful than the Bijou<SYNC Start=1384470><P class='en'>within a jinchuriki especially a lesser<SYNC Start=1387170><P class='en'>jinchuriki not even the nine tails<SYNC Start=1388640><P class='en'>jinchuuriki this would also apply to<SYNC Start=1390140><P class='en'>Obito who as a koto a matsutake like<SYNC Start=1392420><P class='en'>genjutsu he placed on yara so the<SYNC Start=1394760><P class='en'>problem with those theories is that<SYNC Start=1396410><P class='en'>obviously the genjutsu placed on yagura<SYNC Start=1398990><P class='en'>or Filas placed on the eight tails would<SYNC Start=1400850><P class='en'>not be nearly the same as if it was<SYNC Start=1402530><P class='en'>placed on the nine tails as we&#39;ve seen<SYNC Start=1404060><P class='en'>even Madra you see ah in his battle with<SYNC Start=1407030><P class='en'>hoshi Rama or Obito versus Minato Minato<SYNC Start=1410660><P class='en'>states if he&#39;s anything like Madara he<SYNC Start=1413060><P class='en'>cannot hold the nine tails for very long<SYNC Start=1414980><P class='en'>and his genjutsu and it is known<SYNC Start=1416690><P class='en'>throughout the land the holding the nine<SYNC Start=1418310><P class='en'>tails and again jutsu is insanely<SYNC Start=1420110><P class='en'>difficult despite the fact that the<SYNC Start=1422030><P class='en'>tailed beasts are constantly put under<SYNC Start=1423800><P class='en'>genjutsu including the eight tails he<SYNC Start=1425630><P class='en'>was put under again jutsu by Orochimaru<SYNC Start=1427580><P class='en'>at least in filler and he doesn&#39;t even<SYNC Start=1428900><P class='en'>have a Sharingan and then obviously<SYNC Start=1430550><P class='en'>there&#39;s the toast Keyblade and I&#39;ll let<SYNC Start=1433250><P class='en'>Clyde go for that one now as for the<SYNC Start=1435050><P class='en'>telescope blade it&#39;s um it&#39;s a little<SYNC Start=1436910><P class='en'>bit weird because<SYNC Start=1437990><P class='en'>people could say that it kind of works<SYNC Start=1439490><P class='en'>the same way as some pop Tories doing<SYNC Start=1441020><P class='en'>bleep so it may not even affect Ichigo<SYNC Start=1443120><P class='en'>for that matter or we could even make<SYNC Start=1444500><P class='en'>the argument that he&#39;s even too quick to<SYNC Start=1446300><P class='en'>even be hit by the thing and if they if<SYNC Start=1448280><P class='en'>the Akatsuki themselves are to seal<SYNC Start=1449870><P class='en'>Ichigo with that with a slash way Itachi<SYNC Start=1451730><P class='en'>is already you know in pain from using<SYNC Start=1453320><P class='en'>the Susanoo itself it isn&#39;t looking too<SYNC Start=1455059><P class='en'>good and on top of that it uh it isn&#39;t<SYNC Start=1457400><P class='en'>really a fair thing to say that it could<SYNC Start=1459830><P class='en'>exactly cut just anybody because that<SYNC Start=1462020><P class='en'>would be a quote no-limits fallacy<SYNC Start=1463820><P class='en'>considering that Kakashi&#39;s lightning<SYNC Start=1465380><P class='en'>blade is actually sated that our<SYNC Start=1466850><P class='en'>Kakashi&#39;s arm becomes a famous blade<SYNC Start=1468800><P class='en'>that can cut through anything through<SYNC Start=1471320><P class='en'>anything so if we went to wank the Tasca<SYNC Start=1474200><P class='en'>blade it&#39;s it is a bit unfair to give it<SYNC Start=1477410><P class='en'>that much credit I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s<SYNC Start=1478850><P class='en'>gonna be as handy as a lot of people are<SYNC Start=1480290><P class='en'>gonna say in this battle and on top of<SYNC Start=1481970><P class='en'>that like even just hitting Hur lines<SYNC Start=1483320><P class='en'>gonna be too much trouble yeah obviously<SYNC Start=1485300><P class='en'>the Tosca blade it attacks things you<SYNC Start=1487910><P class='en'>have to stab them for it to seal not<SYNC Start=1489710><P class='en'>even just cut however obviously when it<SYNC Start=1491720><P class='en'>comes to the war aki geo yet the<SYNC Start=1492980><P class='en'>peruvian fast and then you have to prove<SYNC Start=1495260><P class='en'>once again that it actually has the<SYNC Start=1496910><P class='en'>power required to cut someone on that<SYNC Start=1498559><P class='en'>level you can&#39;t just have a no limits<SYNC Start=1500240><P class='en'>fallacy where you can just cut through<SYNC Start=1501590><P class='en'>absolutely everything especially<SYNC Start=1502520><P class='en'>universe like bleach where hacks are<SYNC Start=1504200><P class='en'>negated by raw power and obviously it<SYNC Start=1506240><P class='en'>goes back to Kakashi and Kakashi she&#39;s a<SYNC Start=1507830><P class='en'>character who couldn&#39;t even he couldn&#39;t<SYNC Start=1509420><P class='en'>even cut through like most of the<SYNC Start=1511160><P class='en'>version to Jin Turkey he did cut through<SYNC Start=1513140><P class='en'>a lot of them however there are many<SYNC Start=1514309><P class='en'>instances where it was more like who&#39;s<SYNC Start=1515840><P class='en'>throwing a hard punch like next to a guy<SYNC Start=1517550><P class='en'>so it is a little bit weird to use that<SYNC Start=1519530><P class='en'>comparison that also goes back to Hidan<SYNC Start=1521660><P class='en'>Ichigo has a zanpakuto which is a Soul<SYNC Start=1524420><P class='en'>cutter and it actually attacks you on a<SYNC Start=1526760><P class='en'>spiritual level<SYNC Start=1527870><P class='en'>so if Ichigo were to annihilate or fully<SYNC Start=1530840><P class='en'>attack he&#39;d on who does not have the<SYNC Start=1532460><P class='en'>durability to withstand any of his<SYNC Start=1533780><P class='en'>attacks he not is not getting up from it<SYNC Start=1535670><P class='en'>his soul will be annihilated and his<SYNC Start=1537500><P class='en'>body will be vaporized even if he was<SYNC Start=1539600><P class='en'>immortal we have seen that he Don&#39;s body<SYNC Start=1541160><P class='en'>isn&#39;t like majin buu where we like<SYNC Start=1543050><P class='en'>recovers or like regenerates itself<SYNC Start=1544970><P class='en'>instantly yes have conquers you put back<SYNC Start=1547100><P class='en'>on his head and stuff like that so if<SYNC Start=1548660><P class='en'>his body is like atomized or he&#39;s just<SYNC Start=1550760><P class='en'>completely removed from existence which<SYNC Start=1553010><P class='en'>Quincy&#39;s are actually able to remove<SYNC Start=1554420><P class='en'>people from existence let alone Ichigo<SYNC Start=1556250><P class='en'>who is also his Quincy powers it&#39;s not<SYNC Start=1558140><P class='en'>looking good for hidan same would go for<SYNC Start=1559760><P class='en'>a kakuzu and Conan they aren&#39;t really<SYNC Start=1562730><P class='en'>doing much either especially since<SYNC Start=1563840><P class='en'>they&#39;re raw power based fighters and<SYNC Start=1565730><P class='en'>Ichigo has more raw power and months<SYNC Start=1567980><P class='en'>more stamina than they do<SYNC Start=1569300><P class='en'>yeah just weak<SYNC Start=1570420><P class='en'>Modern Warfare 2 claymore said I been<SYNC Start=1572370><P class='en'>doing she&#39;s a filler character in this<SYNC Start=1573990><P class='en'>one and finally just one more thing to<SYNC Start=1575940><P class='en'>mention is that a lot of people will say<SYNC Start=1577440><P class='en'>just like the Tosca blade well what if<SYNC Start=1579210><P class='en'>Ichigo gets thrown in obito&#39;s karma we<SYNC Start=1581280><P class='en'>dimension well there are some big issues<SYNC Start=1582750><P class='en'>that Obito has and that&#39;s that not only<SYNC Start=1584640><P class='en'>can hollows especially at the level of<SYNC Start=1586530><P class='en'>earth your own above which Ichigo<SYNC Start=1587820><P class='en'>absolutely is in the wake of mondo saga<SYNC Start=1589650><P class='en'>let alone the the war arc okay he can<SYNC Start=1592320><P class='en'>literally just break out of a dimension<SYNC Start=1594210><P class='en'>and he could also open up the nagashi on<SYNC Start=1596220><P class='en'>which hollows can do they could just<SYNC Start=1597480><P class='en'>open up a portal and leave if you want<SYNC Start=1599130><P class='en'>to blank ichigo&#39;s Shinigami form I don&#39;t<SYNC Start=1600960><P class='en'>even know if he can do this but he could<SYNC Start=1602100><P class='en'>technically open up the senkaimon and<SYNC Start=1603810><P class='en'>leave so he&#39;s got like three options<SYNC Start=1605820><P class='en'>there may be two of you know two at best<SYNC Start=1607440><P class='en'>but still yeah there&#39;s nothing that<SYNC Start=1608640><P class='en'>Obito can do to him either so not<SYNC Start=1610020><P class='en'>looking too good once again at the end<SYNC Start=1611640><P class='en'>of the day Ichigo is more of a rival to<SYNC Start=1614100><P class='en'>the Akatsuki and as a spark I don&#39;t care<SYNC Start=1616560><P class='en'>if you think the akatsuki beats a spot<SYNC Start=1618240><P class='en'>our Ichigo if you think a spot our key<SYNC Start=1620010><P class='en'>Ichigo beats the Akatsuki I just want us<SYNC Start=1621840><P class='en'>all to universally agree the war arc<SYNC Start=1624390><P class='en'>what&#39;s that which of course we&#39;ll be<SYNC Start=1626220><P class='en'>going into more detail in naruto vs<SYNC Start=1628560><P class='en'>ichigo and other than that speaking of<SYNC Start=1630420><P class='en'>naruto if you guys want to see in naruto<SYNC Start=1632340><P class='en'>versus the Espada maybe you can go over<SYNC Start=1634140><P class='en'>which arcs of Naruto compared to the<SYNC Start=1635970><P class='en'>Espada then it hit us up wall gladly do<SYNC Start=1638730><P class='en'>that as well and in the meantime check<SYNC Start=1640050><P class='en'>out moderate IRS&#39;s the Akatsuki if<SYNC Start=1641910><P class='en'>you&#39;re looking for more inverse
