1
0:00:00.060 --> 0:00:03.389
I was stupid in my last video five early

2
0:00:03.389 --> 0:00:05.940
signs of a garbage anime protagonist I

3
0:00:05.940 --> 0:00:09.450
said hey if this gets 15,000 likes I

4
0:00:09.450 --> 0:00:11.250
will upload five early signs of a

5
0:00:11.250 --> 0:00:13.290
garbage anime villain within a week of

6
0:00:13.290 --> 0:00:16.139
it hitting 15,000 likes well apparently

7
0:00:16.139 --> 0:00:18.210
you guys liked it I don't know a fifteen

8
0:00:18.210 --> 0:00:20.070
thousand likes right away so here you go

9
0:00:20.070 --> 0:00:22.769
from five early signs of a garbage anime

10
0:00:22.769 --> 0:00:25.740
villain this is a completely educational

11
0:00:25.740 --> 0:00:28.769
non meme whatsoever our video that is

12
0:00:28.769 --> 0:00:31.349
purely to help you in your quest to

13
0:00:31.349 --> 0:00:33.180
picking out absolutely trash enemy

14
0:00:33.180 --> 0:00:35.010
villains right from the start you'll

15
0:00:35.010 --> 0:00:36.450
find it's much easier than you think

16
0:00:36.450 --> 0:00:39.480
after you see these five clauses that

17
0:00:39.480 --> 0:00:41.460
are nearly invisible to the naked eye

18
0:00:41.460 --> 0:00:44.010
that once elucidated will shine forth on

19
0:00:44.010 --> 0:00:45.780
some how most two enemy villains but

20
0:00:45.780 --> 0:00:47.910
that's not the point the point is this

21
0:00:47.910 --> 0:00:51.750
is purely as a public service video to

22
0:00:51.750 --> 0:00:54.570
help and not to completely just mask

23
0:00:54.570 --> 0:00:56.100
this as an excuse to sarcastically

24
0:00:56.100 --> 0:00:58.289
insult anime villains or a thinly veiled

25
0:00:58.289 --> 0:01:00.660
excuse to crap over anime not for any

26
0:01:00.660 --> 0:01:02.370
particular reason aside from the fact

27
0:01:02.370 --> 0:01:03.960
that it's a hell of a lot of fun okay

28
0:01:03.960 --> 0:01:07.860
good well it's time to up the ante when

29
0:01:07.860 --> 0:01:11.790
this video hits 20,000 likes within a

30
0:01:11.790 --> 0:01:13.470
week from hitting that or perhaps

31
0:01:13.470 --> 0:01:15.479
earlier if I never hit that I will be

32
0:01:15.479 --> 0:01:17.700
making a video 5 early signs of a

33
0:01:17.700 --> 0:01:20.310
garbage anime fight and I actually think

34
0:01:20.310 --> 0:01:21.900
that's gonna be a pretty dope one so

35
0:01:21.900 --> 0:01:24.869
like away fanbase and let us begin with

36
0:01:24.869 --> 0:01:27.090
early sign of a garbage villain number 1

37
0:01:27.090 --> 0:01:29.250
as you are all aware before meeting the

38
0:01:29.250 --> 0:01:31.650
main villain ever you always end up

39
0:01:31.650 --> 0:01:34.200
meeting his army of cronies because what

40
0:01:34.200 --> 0:01:36.210
villain can properly do anything without

41
0:01:36.210 --> 0:01:38.280
an army of cronies II you get what I'm

42
0:01:38.280 --> 0:01:38.670
saying

43
0:01:38.670 --> 0:01:40.799
now the sign that it's a garbage villain

44
0:01:40.799 --> 0:01:44.159
is simply due to what the cronies add to

45
0:01:44.159 --> 0:01:46.049
the story first and foremost if there's

46
0:01:46.049 --> 0:01:47.880
a number of cronies that's a bad sign

47
0:01:47.880 --> 0:01:50.549
the 9 Akatsuki the seven sins of

48
0:01:50.549 --> 0:01:53.340
purgatory the Arashi on six the nine

49
0:01:53.340 --> 0:01:56.759
gates of hell the 10 Espada the 13

50
0:01:56.759 --> 0:01:58.979
members of the phantom troupe the 10

51
0:01:58.979 --> 0:02:02.070
commandments the seven homunculus the

52
0:02:02.070 --> 0:02:04.710
sense we 7 if the villain group tells

53
0:02:04.710 --> 0:02:06.450
you the amount of villains in the group

54
0:02:06.450 --> 0:02:08.520
in the name of the group well then I

55
0:02:08.520 --> 0:02:11.160
can't commend the leadership skills of

56
0:02:11.160 --> 0:02:12.660
whoever's running the thing it's like

57
0:02:12.660 --> 0:02:13.250
this

58
0:02:13.250 --> 0:02:15.050
each group of several people that

59
0:02:15.050 --> 0:02:16.670
operates in the shadows and they're all

60
0:02:16.670 --> 0:02:19.700
badass and they're so badass and secrets

61
0:02:19.700 --> 0:02:21.260
in fact we're gonna tell you exactly how

62
0:02:21.260 --> 0:02:22.970
many of them there are so they can match

63
0:02:22.970 --> 0:02:25.040
up exactly equally to all of the main

64
0:02:25.040 --> 0:02:26.750
characters that fight them they all lose

65
0:02:26.750 --> 0:02:28.280
one-on-one fights and then the main

66
0:02:28.280 --> 0:02:30.230
character takes down the main bad guy I

67
0:02:30.230 --> 0:02:32.030
see this as relatively counter

68
0:02:32.030 --> 0:02:34.190
production in the art of stealth and it

69
0:02:34.190 --> 0:02:36.350
does not bode well if the main villain

70
0:02:36.350 --> 0:02:38.870
thinks it's a pretty wacky cool idea to

71
0:02:38.870 --> 0:02:40.400
put a number in the title of his group

72
0:02:40.400 --> 0:02:42.230
but in any case that's not the only

73
0:02:42.230 --> 0:02:44.030
thing we can see from the cronies you

74
0:02:44.030 --> 0:02:46.280
can immediately tell if there's a little

75
0:02:46.280 --> 0:02:49.010
bit wrong fishy with the melon if you

76
0:02:49.010 --> 0:02:50.480
know they end up fighting the guys in

77
0:02:50.480 --> 0:02:52.220
the group one at a time or at least in

78
0:02:52.220 --> 0:02:54.530
pairs or whatever the hell obviously the

79
0:02:54.530 --> 0:02:56.209
number in the group is to scare everyone

80
0:02:56.209 --> 0:02:58.250
else because each of them is so powerful

81
0:02:58.250 --> 0:03:00.680
in fact more often than not on an

82
0:03:00.680 --> 0:03:02.810
individual level a single member from

83
0:03:02.810 --> 0:03:03.830
one of these groups should be able to

84
0:03:03.830 --> 0:03:05.900
take out throngs of good guys well

85
0:03:05.900 --> 0:03:08.720
imagine putting them all together one

86
0:03:08.720 --> 0:03:11.150
place the main villain is so smart in

87
0:03:11.150 --> 0:03:13.520
stealthy that'll only send them one at a

88
0:03:13.520 --> 0:03:15.890
time Power Rangers style to defeat the

89
0:03:15.890 --> 0:03:18.230
good guys and honestly they're defeated

90
0:03:18.230 --> 0:03:20.420
by teamwork and stuff so great plan

91
0:03:20.420 --> 0:03:22.549
their main bad guy then the main bad guy

92
0:03:22.549 --> 0:03:24.110
secretly is more powerful than all of

93
0:03:24.110 --> 0:03:25.190
them put together so he didn't really

94
0:03:25.190 --> 0:03:26.660
need them which begs the question why he

95
0:03:26.660 --> 0:03:28.130
originally had at them and that's

96
0:03:28.130 --> 0:03:29.480
because he didn't want to get his hands

97
0:03:29.480 --> 0:03:31.549
muddied in the dirty work of the world

98
0:03:31.549 --> 0:03:33.830
shut up main bad guy if you're sending

99
0:03:33.830 --> 0:03:36.200
out your cronies individually to die but

100
0:03:36.200 --> 0:03:37.430
it doesn't actually bother you because

101
0:03:37.430 --> 0:03:38.870
you're secretly way stronger than all of

102
0:03:38.870 --> 0:03:41.330
them put together for shame I mean

103
0:03:41.330 --> 0:03:42.500
literally I don't know what's going

104
0:03:42.500 --> 0:03:43.940
through the guy's head for the same

105
0:03:43.940 --> 0:03:45.500
exact price he could have been a

106
0:03:45.500 --> 0:03:47.870
relatively good guy still be overpowered

107
0:03:47.870 --> 0:03:50.299
and then by default amass a harem of

108
0:03:50.299 --> 0:03:52.579
anime whamon by his sides to defeat the

109
0:03:52.579 --> 0:03:54.410
forces of evil but there's more that you

110
0:03:54.410 --> 0:03:56.180
can learn about the cronies more often

111
0:03:56.180 --> 0:03:58.700
than not if the cronies around purely to

112
0:03:58.700 --> 0:04:01.220
hype the abilities of the main bad guy

113
0:04:01.220 --> 0:04:02.780
then you didn't really need the chrony

114
0:04:02.780 --> 0:04:04.250
there at all and he was just their type

115
0:04:04.250 --> 0:04:06.350
the main bad guy further this main bad

116
0:04:06.350 --> 0:04:08.930
guy is walking around with a hype squad

117
0:04:08.930 --> 0:04:11.720
a literal group of elite doofuses to

118
0:04:11.720 --> 0:04:14.269
purely flex on the haters I mean in like

119
0:04:14.269 --> 0:04:16.250
the seven deadly sins when Goliath first

120
0:04:16.250 --> 0:04:18.169
fought the sins the sins power level

121
0:04:18.169 --> 0:04:20.450
averaged at around 3,000 each and you

122
0:04:20.450 --> 0:04:23.000
land at a power level of like 26,000 he

123
0:04:23.000 --> 0:04:25.010
completely obliterated them and then of

124
0:04:25.010 --> 0:04:26.120
course he was secretly

125
0:04:26.120 --> 0:04:28.010
the weakest of the 10 commandments all

126
0:04:28.010 --> 0:04:30.800
along and then every sin manages to get

127
0:04:30.800 --> 0:04:32.750
crazy power boosts way over power all of

128
0:04:32.750 --> 0:04:34.940
them and bam demon king five hundred

129
0:04:34.940 --> 0:04:37.400
thousand power level yeah Goliath was

130
0:04:37.400 --> 0:04:39.380
really helpful wasn't he or you have

131
0:04:39.380 --> 0:04:41.180
someone like Aizen and bleach and his

132
0:04:41.180 --> 0:04:43.699
epic group of Espada each with a number

133
0:04:43.699 --> 0:04:46.340
ranking them and power from lowest to

134
0:04:46.340 --> 0:04:48.500
highest and then he kind of just left a

135
0:04:48.500 --> 0:04:50.270
bunch of them in hueco mundo to die off

136
0:04:50.270 --> 0:04:51.949
fighting some of the captains that were

137
0:04:51.949 --> 0:04:53.360
there while he invaded the human world

138
0:04:53.360 --> 0:04:55.310
now if he's already raking them

139
0:04:55.310 --> 0:04:56.810
consecutively from weakest to strongest

140
0:04:56.810 --> 0:04:58.610
and they're fighting them taking them

141
0:04:58.610 --> 0:05:00.889
down one at a time of course none of the

142
0:05:00.889 --> 0:05:02.090
Espada thought it was a good idea to

143
0:05:02.090 --> 0:05:04.280
team up against the Soul Reapers but hey

144
0:05:04.280 --> 0:05:06.860
I'm not the tactical mastermind here and

145
0:05:06.860 --> 0:05:08.540
it's not even that Aizen was stupid in

146
0:05:08.540 --> 0:05:10.790
this regard aizen's a freaking genius he

147
0:05:10.790 --> 0:05:12.139
didn't need the Espada they were just

148
0:05:12.139 --> 0:05:13.610
kind of there to make the fights cooler

149
0:05:13.610 --> 0:05:15.290
he could have just invaded the human

150
0:05:15.290 --> 0:05:17.180
world with his entire group of Espada

151
0:05:17.180 --> 0:05:20.150
and then oh my god ichigo byakuya

152
0:05:20.150 --> 0:05:22.130
kampachi and all the other guys that

153
0:05:22.130 --> 0:05:23.720
were there are gonna be trapped in hueco

154
0:05:23.720 --> 0:05:25.430
mundo until they find a way out well

155
0:05:25.430 --> 0:05:27.320
everyone is on his side to deal with

156
0:05:27.320 --> 0:05:29.449
them but no they're just too flexed so

157
0:05:29.449 --> 0:05:30.979
therefore it's much cooler if they have

158
0:05:30.979 --> 0:05:33.320
individual fights so that is side one of

159
0:05:33.320 --> 0:05:35.330
a potentially garbage anime villain keep

160
0:05:35.330 --> 0:05:37.130
an eye on the cronies but now let's get

161
0:05:37.130 --> 0:05:38.990
into the meat and potatoes of the man

162
0:05:38.990 --> 0:05:41.090
himself I don't see man to some sexist

163
0:05:41.090 --> 0:05:42.680
they say man because there are very few

164
0:05:42.680 --> 0:05:44.810
enemy whamming that are actually main

165
0:05:44.810 --> 0:05:46.940
villains too if the main villain is

166
0:05:46.940 --> 0:05:49.639
actually an enemy whamon now not trying

167
0:05:49.639 --> 0:05:52.160
to insult anyone here by saying this but

168
0:05:52.160 --> 0:05:54.500
let's be frank I made a list of the top

169
0:05:54.500 --> 0:05:56.510
10 anime villains and they also had like

170
0:05:56.510 --> 0:05:58.820
20 honorable mentions not gonna lie

171
0:05:58.820 --> 0:06:01.160
don't think any were whamon which is

172
0:06:01.160 --> 0:06:03.740
very sad gender equality is extremely

173
0:06:03.740 --> 0:06:05.690
important and must be stressed so

174
0:06:05.690 --> 0:06:07.789
therefore I think it's crucial to say

175
0:06:07.789 --> 0:06:09.560
that anime whamon should have the right

176
0:06:09.560 --> 0:06:11.240
to be amazing villains as well but

177
0:06:11.240 --> 0:06:12.830
they're not they're like oh here's an

178
0:06:12.830 --> 0:06:15.110
epic anime whamon villain Kaguya yeah

179
0:06:15.110 --> 0:06:16.940
that's right literally farted out of

180
0:06:16.940 --> 0:06:18.979
Kishimoto z-- but just because he didn't

181
0:06:18.979 --> 0:06:20.419
want modern to be the main villain or

182
0:06:20.419 --> 0:06:22.610
something early signs of a garbage anime

183
0:06:22.610 --> 0:06:24.620
villain if they pop out of nowhere with

184
0:06:24.620 --> 0:06:26.060
zero hype but secretly

185
0:06:26.060 --> 0:06:28.400
they're the alien goddess overpowered

186
0:06:28.400 --> 0:06:30.380
creature that will take over the planet

187
0:06:30.380 --> 0:06:32.300
with their insane abilities and shiz but

188
0:06:32.300 --> 0:06:34.010
of course there is one exception to this

189
0:06:34.010 --> 0:06:36.349
an exception where an anime villain can

190
0:06:36.349 --> 0:06:38.600
actually be both good and

191
0:06:38.600 --> 0:06:40.670
Waymon and that is if they were secretly

192
0:06:40.670 --> 0:06:42.560
in love with the main character and it

193
0:06:42.560 --> 0:06:44.150
doesn't even need to be so secret the

194
0:06:44.150 --> 0:06:45.980
main villain andrey creators as well as

195
0:06:45.980 --> 0:06:48.170
s death from a cameo kill show that with

196
0:06:48.170 --> 0:06:50.600
spades strong women loving the main

197
0:06:50.600 --> 0:06:52.700
character or something along those lines

198
0:06:52.700 --> 0:06:55.370
so it's not that we have no epic anime

199
0:06:55.370 --> 0:06:56.930
villain whamon but it's usually a

200
0:06:56.930 --> 0:06:58.910
telltale sign that it's not gonna be the

201
0:06:58.910 --> 0:07:00.380
most wonderful villain on the face of

202
0:07:00.380 --> 0:07:00.890
the planet

203
0:07:00.890 --> 0:07:02.420
not trying to be sexist here or anything

204
0:07:02.420 --> 0:07:05.720
I am just once again advocating gender

205
0:07:05.720 --> 0:07:07.640
equality saying that women have the

206
0:07:07.640 --> 0:07:10.370
right to be terribly horrible anime

207
0:07:10.370 --> 0:07:12.950
villains as well and I want to see women

208
0:07:12.950 --> 0:07:14.630
being destroyed by the main characters

209
0:07:14.630 --> 0:07:16.640
and extremely brutal ways that didn't

210
0:07:16.640 --> 0:07:17.240
come out right

211
0:07:17.240 --> 0:07:19.550
anyway moving on sign number three and

212
0:07:19.550 --> 0:07:21.050
once again this is a bit of a

213
0:07:21.050 --> 0:07:23.690
conglomerate early sign of a garbage

214
0:07:23.690 --> 0:07:25.700
anime villain and it's anything that

215
0:07:25.700 --> 0:07:27.830
involves building up the villains

216
0:07:27.830 --> 0:07:30.260
ideology so now there are some really

217
0:07:30.260 --> 0:07:32.270
epic villains really cool psychologies

218
0:07:32.270 --> 0:07:34.130
and ideology but unfortunately the vast

219
0:07:34.130 --> 0:07:36.440
majority do not fall under those exact

220
0:07:36.440 --> 0:07:38.660
guidelines if the main villain is

221
0:07:38.660 --> 0:07:40.850
actually related to the main character

222
0:07:40.850 --> 0:07:42.560
because he was either trained by the

223
0:07:42.560 --> 0:07:45.470
same master or he was the master or he

224
0:07:45.470 --> 0:07:47.630
was the wayward student or he was his

225
0:07:47.630 --> 0:07:49.730
father or his uncle or his stepbrothers

226
0:07:49.730 --> 0:07:51.830
pet goat you know there's a problem you

227
0:07:51.830 --> 0:07:53.330
have this massive world with this

228
0:07:53.330 --> 0:07:55.490
probably underdog protagonist that's

229
0:07:55.490 --> 0:07:57.140
gonna try to claw his way up from the

230
0:07:57.140 --> 0:07:58.490
very bottom where no one expected

231
0:07:58.490 --> 0:08:00.650
anything of him surprise the main

232
0:08:00.650 --> 0:08:03.380
villain all along is literally just like

233
0:08:03.380 --> 0:08:05.660
him to some degree let's look at some

234
0:08:05.660 --> 0:08:08.090
villains in Naruto pain trained by the

235
0:08:08.090 --> 0:08:11.120
same master Madara from the same clan as

236
0:08:11.120 --> 0:08:13.370
the other main character there we go we

237
0:08:13.370 --> 0:08:15.320
got both main characters to have their

238
0:08:15.320 --> 0:08:17.780
step cousins attempt world domination

239
0:08:17.780 --> 0:08:19.400
lovely who's the main villain in the

240
0:08:19.400 --> 0:08:22.040
seven deadly sins well is it Mele Otis's

241
0:08:22.040 --> 0:08:25.160
father what that's like the craziest

242
0:08:25.160 --> 0:08:28.490
coincidence ever but it gets better why

243
0:08:28.490 --> 0:08:30.650
did the villain become evil this is

244
0:08:30.650 --> 0:08:32.659
again part of the upbringing and an

245
0:08:32.659 --> 0:08:34.909
early sign of a garbage anime villain as

246
0:08:34.909 --> 0:08:36.770
if his reasoning to go off the hinges

247
0:08:36.770 --> 0:08:39.409
off the wall nutso is not exactly

248
0:08:39.409 --> 0:08:41.210
something that would befall most people

249
0:08:41.210 --> 0:08:43.460
in their exact situations once again

250
0:08:43.460 --> 0:08:45.290
let's look at Naruto for a moment

251
0:08:45.290 --> 0:08:47.780
Payne's friend died so because that's

252
0:08:47.780 --> 0:08:50.810
very sad he decided world domination

253
0:08:50.810 --> 0:08:53.150
Audra was just a humble dude that didn't

254
0:08:53.150 --> 0:08:54.590
feel like the UGA clan were being

255
0:08:54.590 --> 0:08:56.540
treated fairly in the Lee village world

256
0:08:56.540 --> 0:08:58.220
domination Thai boys

257
0:08:58.220 --> 0:09:00.650
Obito sacrificed himself for his friend

258
0:09:00.650 --> 0:09:02.270
for the good of the world and then it

259
0:09:02.270 --> 0:09:04.490
turns out that the person that he wanted

260
0:09:04.490 --> 0:09:06.860
to save most ended up dying

261
0:09:06.860 --> 0:09:08.779
well did his uh his wife who just died

262
0:09:08.779 --> 0:09:10.190
well in I think that calls for world

263
0:09:10.190 --> 0:09:11.900
domination ladies and gentlemen world

264
0:09:11.900 --> 0:09:14.240
domination in general is a bad sign it's

265
0:09:14.240 --> 0:09:16.460
a way to say the universe effed you so

266
0:09:16.460 --> 0:09:18.320
it's time to eff the universe and it's

267
0:09:18.320 --> 0:09:19.970
not exactly a logic that most of us

268
0:09:19.970 --> 0:09:20.570
follow

269
0:09:20.570 --> 0:09:22.520
I lied that's a logic that way too many

270
0:09:22.520 --> 0:09:24.260
of us follow unfortunately but it

271
0:09:24.260 --> 0:09:26.240
shouldn't be but now it doesn't only

272
0:09:26.240 --> 0:09:28.430
apply to villains that decided they

273
0:09:28.430 --> 0:09:29.900
wanted to take over the world because

274
0:09:29.900 --> 0:09:31.910
that one time they stubbed their toe is

275
0:09:31.910 --> 0:09:33.529
way too painful and it forced them to

276
0:09:33.529 --> 0:09:35.270
become evil and they have some crazy

277
0:09:35.270 --> 0:09:36.920
reasoning as to why that works out but

278
0:09:36.920 --> 0:09:38.390
it applies to any villain who has that

279
0:09:38.390 --> 0:09:40.550
exact same ideology you have some dope

280
0:09:40.550 --> 0:09:42.440
villains like staying from my hero

281
0:09:42.440 --> 0:09:44.779
academia due to this powerful ideology

282
0:09:44.779 --> 0:09:47.000
that caused his view of the world to

283
0:09:47.000 --> 0:09:48.920
warp into something different he had a

284
0:09:48.920 --> 0:09:50.990
different view of what makes a hero he

285
0:09:50.990 --> 0:09:53.060
followed this path of his with such an

286
0:09:53.060 --> 0:09:56.330
intense passion his pure willpower alone

287
0:09:56.330 --> 0:09:58.520
was enough to terrify the heroes

288
0:09:58.520 --> 0:10:00.560
detaining him after he was defeated that

289
0:10:00.560 --> 0:10:02.540
is a powerful ideology for a villain

290
0:10:02.540 --> 0:10:04.190
it's a great reason for him to do what

291
0:10:04.190 --> 0:10:05.960
he's doing not to say that I fully agree

292
0:10:05.960 --> 0:10:09.050
and can condone the idea of killing good

293
0:10:09.050 --> 0:10:10.550
people because they're not good for the

294
0:10:10.550 --> 0:10:12.440
right reasons not exactly what I'm

295
0:10:12.440 --> 0:10:14.600
trying to push here fam but then you

296
0:10:14.600 --> 0:10:15.980
compare him to other villains in the

297
0:10:15.980 --> 0:10:17.150
series like I don't know

298
0:10:17.150 --> 0:10:19.280
Tamura Palmer is a pretty great villain

299
0:10:19.280 --> 0:10:21.530
and uh that's all lovely but ask him his

300
0:10:21.530 --> 0:10:23.000
motivations and it might give you a

301
0:10:23.000 --> 0:10:24.710
telltale sign of what he's willing to

302
0:10:24.710 --> 0:10:26.630
become so tomorrow what do you want to

303
0:10:26.630 --> 0:10:28.550
do well I wouldn't kill all might

304
0:10:28.550 --> 0:10:31.670
because he's good and I'm evil Wow Tomer

305
0:10:31.670 --> 0:10:33.020
are very cool but uh

306
0:10:33.020 --> 0:10:34.940
all-4-one was the guy training you what

307
0:10:34.940 --> 0:10:37.040
does he plan on doing oh he just wants

308
0:10:37.040 --> 0:10:39.260
to destroy the world or take it over or

309
0:10:39.260 --> 0:10:41.150
make evil reign supreme or whatever very

310
0:10:41.150 --> 0:10:43.550
epic ideologies right here fan and it's

311
0:10:43.550 --> 0:10:45.680
not at all an early sign of a garbage

312
0:10:45.680 --> 0:10:47.510
villain because that's not what this

313
0:10:47.510 --> 0:10:49.880
video is this video is not pointing at

314
0:10:49.880 --> 0:10:51.410
specific villains saying why they're

315
0:10:51.410 --> 0:10:53.150
garbage but if they're evil for the sake

316
0:10:53.150 --> 0:10:54.740
of evil or if they want to take over the

317
0:10:54.740 --> 0:10:56.089
world because they want to take over the

318
0:10:56.089 --> 0:10:58.730
world not a good sign at all unless it's

319
0:10:58.730 --> 0:11:00.830
rider from fate/zero he has full rights

320
0:11:00.830 --> 0:11:03.530
who wants to take over the world and not

321
0:11:03.530 --> 0:11:04.910
only do I approve of

322
0:11:04.910 --> 0:11:07.310
actions but I condoned them if you are

323
0:11:07.310 --> 0:11:09.830
like Ryder you too deserve to take over

324
0:11:09.830 --> 0:11:11.570
the world and cause world domination but

325
0:11:11.570 --> 0:11:13.280
not because you're evil for the sake of

326
0:11:13.280 --> 0:11:15.620
evil evil for the sake of evil is bad so

327
0:11:15.620 --> 0:11:17.570
Kaguya showing up last minute is trying

328
0:11:17.570 --> 0:11:19.310
to wipe everything out hmm

329
0:11:19.310 --> 0:11:21.410
if you ask the demon king from seven

330
0:11:21.410 --> 0:11:23.300
deadly sins yo demon king why are you

331
0:11:23.300 --> 0:11:24.830
making such a mess trying to destroy

332
0:11:24.830 --> 0:11:27.170
everyone and the answers because I'm the

333
0:11:27.170 --> 0:11:29.570
demon king you know that is not a good

334
0:11:29.570 --> 0:11:31.490
sign you gotta take the Scooby Doo

335
0:11:31.490 --> 0:11:33.230
approach a little bit in scooby Doo

336
0:11:33.230 --> 0:11:35.420
every single episode the gang who goes

337
0:11:35.420 --> 0:11:37.700
to some new place and there's some masks

338
0:11:37.700 --> 0:11:39.950
to l'm going as destroying shoes or

339
0:11:39.950 --> 0:11:41.270
whatever the hell he decides to be doing

340
0:11:41.270 --> 0:11:43.520
now you have a ton of characters in the

341
0:11:43.520 --> 0:11:46.160
series you have the evil hermit

342
0:11:46.160 --> 0:11:48.800
that's tries to get visitors away you

343
0:11:48.800 --> 0:11:50.870
have the extremely rich guy that's

344
0:11:50.870 --> 0:11:52.820
trying to take over the land

345
0:11:52.820 --> 0:11:55.550
you have the angry hobo with anger

346
0:11:55.550 --> 0:11:58.220
management issues and you have Steve

347
0:11:58.220 --> 0:12:01.070
your regular nice guy that invites them

348
0:12:01.070 --> 0:12:04.190
in and buys them coffee well the bad

349
0:12:04.190 --> 0:12:06.230
guys gonna be Steve I know pretty

350
0:12:06.230 --> 0:12:08.090
mind-blowing right the rest is just like

351
0:12:08.090 --> 0:12:10.010
evil for the sake of evil not Steve

352
0:12:10.010 --> 0:12:12.560
Steve avoids that entire problem and is

353
0:12:12.560 --> 0:12:14.240
one of the greatest villains in all of

354
0:12:14.240 --> 0:12:15.590
anime in fact he would have probably

355
0:12:15.590 --> 0:12:17.060
even gotten away with it too if it

356
0:12:17.060 --> 0:12:18.650
wasn't for those meddling kids and that

357
0:12:18.650 --> 0:12:21.440
dumb dog but sometimes they do have

358
0:12:21.440 --> 0:12:23.930
crazy cool ideologies a crazy cool

359
0:12:23.930 --> 0:12:25.910
psychology backing up what they're doing

360
0:12:25.910 --> 0:12:28.430
however even so that does not completely

361
0:12:28.430 --> 0:12:30.500
save them this is an early sign of a

362
0:12:30.500 --> 0:12:32.840
garbage annum evil a terrible ideology a

363
0:12:32.840 --> 0:12:35.060
horrible psychology evil for the sake of

364
0:12:35.060 --> 0:12:37.250
evil bad motives yes but even with all

365
0:12:37.250 --> 0:12:39.350
the right motives and even with no hype

366
0:12:39.350 --> 0:12:41.780
and not necessarily related to the main

367
0:12:41.780 --> 0:12:43.580
character if everything was part of

368
0:12:43.580 --> 0:12:46.670
their plan sorry fam that is not how it

369
0:12:46.670 --> 0:12:48.980
works and I do not relate to you except

370
0:12:48.980 --> 0:12:50.870
for Aizen you're amazing and I do relate

371
0:12:50.870 --> 0:12:52.370
to you I made a whole video on Aizen

372
0:12:52.370 --> 0:12:54.500
he's amazing check it out not the point

373
0:12:54.500 --> 0:12:56.210
if everything was secretly part of your

374
0:12:56.210 --> 0:12:59.060
evil plan then nothing was I don't think

375
0:12:59.060 --> 0:13:00.290
that's how that line works but we're

376
0:13:00.290 --> 0:13:02.510
gonna go with it anyway hahaha I knew

377
0:13:02.510 --> 0:13:03.830
you would take three steps forward on

378
0:13:03.830 --> 0:13:05.840
this very day and I have planned this

379
0:13:05.840 --> 0:13:08.810
trap 14 years ago expecting your arrival

380
0:13:08.810 --> 0:13:10.940
right now but how do you know because I

381
0:13:10.940 --> 0:13:12.680
dyed it every moment in your life making

382
0:13:12.680 --> 0:13:14.540
you just as strong as you are now so

383
0:13:14.540 --> 0:13:15.920
that you could be here taking these

384
0:13:15.920 --> 0:13:18.480
three steps and I am very cool but

385
0:13:18.480 --> 0:13:20.310
but how is that possible silence I do

386
0:13:20.310 --> 0:13:21.690
not need to answer questions from you

387
0:13:21.690 --> 0:13:23.459
fools not a good sign for an enemy

388
0:13:23.459 --> 0:13:24.990
villain want to know a way better

389
0:13:24.990 --> 0:13:27.269
approach to the exact same scenario but

390
0:13:27.269 --> 0:13:29.550
changes it all into a much better light

391
0:13:29.550 --> 0:13:31.350
I have planned out your entire life

392
0:13:31.350 --> 0:13:33.149
since your very birth knowing that you

393
0:13:33.149 --> 0:13:35.250
would take these 3 steps exactly right

394
0:13:35.250 --> 0:13:37.709
now here today at this exact power level

395
0:13:37.709 --> 0:13:38.850
you're at because they pitted every

396
0:13:38.850 --> 0:13:40.199
opponent against you to make you just as

397
0:13:40.199 --> 0:13:41.610
strong as you could possibly be to have

398
0:13:41.610 --> 0:13:43.050
the most epic fight against me where you

399
0:13:43.050 --> 0:13:44.760
just barely win and then when the main

400
0:13:44.760 --> 0:13:48.180
character says how did you know if you

401
0:13:48.180 --> 0:13:49.980
would have gone with the generic silence

402
0:13:49.980 --> 0:13:52.470
fool or because I am very cool answer

403
0:13:52.470 --> 0:13:54.120
not a good sign for a villain but he

404
0:13:54.120 --> 0:13:56.279
would say oh how did I know because it's

405
0:13:56.279 --> 0:13:59.010
me do that is top to your signs of an

406
0:13:59.010 --> 0:14:00.120
enemy village and I know that's not

407
0:14:00.120 --> 0:14:01.350
exactly what this video was supposed to

408
0:14:01.350 --> 0:14:03.300
be but I just had to talk about a very

409
0:14:03.300 --> 0:14:04.920
easy way to get out of the entire

410
0:14:04.920 --> 0:14:06.690
situation and if you really want to add

411
0:14:06.690 --> 0:14:08.430
some spice when the main villain says so

412
0:14:08.430 --> 0:14:09.990
he planned out your entire life the good

413
0:14:09.990 --> 0:14:12.360
guys supposed to say Nami and then the

414
0:14:12.360 --> 0:14:13.920
bad guy could skip right to what does

415
0:14:13.920 --> 0:14:16.709
you uh do this and then you know it

416
0:14:16.709 --> 0:14:18.360
evolves into an epic battle but not

417
0:14:18.360 --> 0:14:20.399
every anime is JoJo's and I understand

418
0:14:20.399 --> 0:14:22.139
why not every anime is amazing to that

419
0:14:22.139 --> 0:14:24.449
degree of writing however if he planned

420
0:14:24.449 --> 0:14:25.889
out your entire life and he's not gonna

421
0:14:25.889 --> 0:14:27.779
give you a logical way how he did it not

422
0:14:27.779 --> 0:14:29.519
a great sign of a villain black zetsu

423
0:14:29.519 --> 0:14:31.920
screw yourself and as far as the fifth

424
0:14:31.920 --> 0:14:35.190
and final early sign of a garbage anime

425
0:14:35.190 --> 0:14:37.620
villain their powers I know this sounds

426
0:14:37.620 --> 0:14:39.690
generic and very surface level stuff I'm

427
0:14:39.690 --> 0:14:41.670
skipping all the themes not talking

428
0:14:41.670 --> 0:14:43.139
about any of the philosophy of the

429
0:14:43.139 --> 0:14:45.769
series no psychology no ideology no

430
0:14:45.769 --> 0:14:48.180
astrophysics or whatever the hell else I

431
0:14:48.180 --> 0:14:49.740
talk about in my analysis videos where I

432
0:14:49.740 --> 0:14:51.329
make believe I'm smart and whatever no

433
0:14:51.329 --> 0:14:54.060
fewer basic powers if the guy could drop

434
0:14:54.060 --> 0:14:56.010
a meteor that's actually really cool so

435
0:14:56.010 --> 0:14:57.300
I'm gonna give him either a pass on that

436
0:14:57.300 --> 0:14:59.490
one but if you're a guy like lark aid

437
0:14:59.490 --> 0:15:02.100
from Fairy Tail or in fact speaking of

438
0:15:02.100 --> 0:15:03.870
Fairy Tail let's use that as a prime

439
0:15:03.870 --> 0:15:05.670
example of this one I don't want to go

440
0:15:05.670 --> 0:15:08.399
far off topic here but some powers are

441
0:15:08.399 --> 0:15:10.260
so broken it doesn't make sense how

442
0:15:10.260 --> 0:15:11.639
they're defeated and it's not like I

443
0:15:11.639 --> 0:15:12.930
want to make fun of Fairy Tail or

444
0:15:12.930 --> 0:15:14.519
anything here it's not exactly what I'm

445
0:15:14.519 --> 0:15:16.050
being paid for but it's a prime example

446
0:15:16.050 --> 0:15:18.510
as far as this bryggen 12 when the power

447
0:15:18.510 --> 0:15:20.399
levels get out of control Larke aid

448
0:15:20.399 --> 0:15:23.190
dragged Neil from Fairy Tail is part of

449
0:15:23.190 --> 0:15:24.779
this bryggen 12 this extremely

450
0:15:24.779 --> 0:15:27.120
overpowered enemy organization and you

451
0:15:27.120 --> 0:15:28.560
know immediately that there's an issue

452
0:15:28.560 --> 0:15:32.100
because this brigand 12 just there

453
0:15:32.100 --> 0:15:34.350
hi bubs Arif very cool fairytale again

454
0:15:34.350 --> 0:15:35.579
not the point

455
0:15:35.579 --> 0:15:37.800
I think that enemy got the point lark

456
0:15:37.800 --> 0:15:40.620
AIDS abilities include you know having

457
0:15:40.620 --> 0:15:43.529
everyone within a certain radius of him

458
0:15:43.529 --> 0:15:45.990
go into such major orgasms that they

459
0:15:45.990 --> 0:15:48.089
cannot seem to fight that is correct

460
0:15:48.089 --> 0:15:50.250
of course he immediately runs into

461
0:15:50.250 --> 0:15:52.440
battle against like three whamon and all

462
0:15:52.440 --> 0:15:54.029
three of those women all of a sudden

463
0:15:54.029 --> 0:15:56.220
start squealing and breathing heavy and

464
0:15:56.220 --> 0:15:57.420
they fall on the ground and they're

465
0:15:57.420 --> 0:15:59.449
touching themselves in weird places and

466
0:15:59.449 --> 0:16:01.680
Mark aid is one of the greatest villains

467
0:16:01.680 --> 0:16:03.930
in anime I take that all back his other

468
0:16:03.930 --> 0:16:06.209
incredible moves include making everyone

469
0:16:06.209 --> 0:16:08.339
around him suffer from hunger so since

470
0:16:08.339 --> 0:16:10.529
they're hungry all the anime characters

471
0:16:10.529 --> 0:16:11.130
around him

472
0:16:11.130 --> 0:16:12.420
mostly ramen as we've already

473
0:16:12.420 --> 0:16:14.670
established start licking each other and

474
0:16:14.670 --> 0:16:16.380
chewing on each other and taking off

475
0:16:16.380 --> 0:16:18.120
each others clothes to bite each other

476
0:16:18.120 --> 0:16:20.250
in better place I don't know where Kate

477
0:16:20.250 --> 0:16:21.420
is one of the greatest villains of all

478
0:16:21.420 --> 0:16:23.310
time what am I saying here I don't even

479
0:16:23.310 --> 0:16:24.870
know how I'm insulting the guy and

480
0:16:24.870 --> 0:16:26.850
you'll even notice a pretty funny trend

481
0:16:26.850 --> 0:16:28.529
here one of these friggin twelve is this

482
0:16:28.529 --> 0:16:30.569
assassin dude and he has the ability to

483
0:16:30.569 --> 0:16:31.860
trap everyone around him into this

484
0:16:31.860 --> 0:16:33.329
little pocket dimension that he holds in

485
0:16:33.329 --> 0:16:34.889
his palm completely destroying them and

486
0:16:34.889 --> 0:16:35.970
defeating them without even needing to

487
0:16:35.970 --> 0:16:37.769
fight them no matter how powerful they

488
0:16:37.769 --> 0:16:38.880
are no matter who they are

489
0:16:38.880 --> 0:16:41.040
blammo yes he only does it once because

490
0:16:41.040 --> 0:16:42.779
otherwise it would be crazy o P but

491
0:16:42.779 --> 0:16:43.769
they're all trapped in little pocket

492
0:16:43.769 --> 0:16:45.660
dimension since it's so overpowered and

493
0:16:45.660 --> 0:16:47.519
ridiculously strong I don't see how

494
0:16:47.519 --> 0:16:49.500
anyone can ever defeat him in fact I

495
0:16:49.500 --> 0:16:51.300
think he might be able to defeat all of

496
0:16:51.300 --> 0:16:53.459
Fairy Tail however he's extremely shy

497
0:16:53.459 --> 0:16:55.139
and if he sees a ramen that is not fully

498
0:16:55.139 --> 0:16:56.550
clothed he'll be too embarrassed to

499
0:16:56.550 --> 0:16:57.959
fight close his eyes and the web and

500
0:16:57.959 --> 0:16:59.939
will then defeat him spoilers Lucy was

501
0:16:59.939 --> 0:17:01.740
completely naked and managed to teleport

502
0:17:01.740 --> 0:17:02.670
right in front of him

503
0:17:02.670 --> 0:17:05.010
epic win for Fairy Tail other crazy

504
0:17:05.010 --> 0:17:06.839
overpowered characters from this bryggen

505
0:17:06.839 --> 0:17:09.600
12 include this guy that can look into

506
0:17:09.600 --> 0:17:12.058
all of the opponent's memories or even

507
0:17:12.058 --> 0:17:14.220
his friends memories and every foe that

508
0:17:14.220 --> 0:17:15.630
they've ever fought is now reese

509
0:17:15.630 --> 0:17:17.280
summoned back maybe not at their full

510
0:17:17.280 --> 0:17:18.990
power but at most of their power that

511
0:17:18.990 --> 0:17:20.400
they would have to fight them again so

512
0:17:20.400 --> 0:17:21.928
that means even though a bunch of this

513
0:17:21.928 --> 0:17:24.058
bryggen 12 are actually defeated he can

514
0:17:24.058 --> 0:17:27.480
then re summon their memories from the

515
0:17:27.480 --> 0:17:29.280
dead and they're basically as strong as

516
0:17:29.280 --> 0:17:30.720
they were before and annihilating all

517
0:17:30.720 --> 0:17:32.220
their progress probably one of the most

518
0:17:32.220 --> 0:17:33.809
overpowered broken abilities ever that

519
0:17:33.809 --> 0:17:35.820
most anime wouldn't even dare touch but

520
0:17:35.820 --> 0:17:37.890
Fairy Tail is so epic they came up with

521
0:17:37.890 --> 0:17:40.200
a villain it's so strong now uh this

522
0:17:40.200 --> 0:17:42.390
villain decide to go hand-to-hand fight

523
0:17:42.390 --> 0:17:45.250
some opponents and not unite

524
0:17:45.250 --> 0:17:46.929
yeah and the hand fights with the guy

525
0:17:46.929 --> 0:17:48.549
who has the most overpowered ability

526
0:17:48.549 --> 0:17:49.990
every and to just sit in his castle

527
0:17:49.990 --> 0:17:52.179
making an endless army of foes they've

528
0:17:52.179 --> 0:17:54.340
already defeated constantly revive and

529
0:17:54.340 --> 0:17:56.740
continue to fight them very cool but the

530
0:17:56.740 --> 0:17:58.000
problem isn't even that he had to fight

531
0:17:58.000 --> 0:17:59.890
them hand-to-hand because we know that

532
0:17:59.890 --> 0:18:01.330
he had to be defeated eventually the

533
0:18:01.330 --> 0:18:03.789
power is once you introduce any ability

534
0:18:03.789 --> 0:18:05.650
so strong there's no way you could get

535
0:18:05.650 --> 0:18:07.900
around it like Irene for example from

536
0:18:07.900 --> 0:18:10.510
fairytale versus mother crazy powerful

537
0:18:10.510 --> 0:18:12.309
wizard one of this friggin twelve one of

538
0:18:12.309 --> 0:18:13.690
the three strongest to this bryggen

539
0:18:13.690 --> 0:18:15.610
twelve in fact she used a single move

540
0:18:15.610 --> 0:18:19.240
that rearranged the entire continent

541
0:18:19.240 --> 0:18:21.340
they were standing on to destroy the

542
0:18:21.340 --> 0:18:22.929
enemy battle lines and to get certain

543
0:18:22.929 --> 0:18:24.820
people in different places now if you

544
0:18:24.820 --> 0:18:26.679
want to talk Opie broken abilities you

545
0:18:26.679 --> 0:18:28.270
don't get much more than that she did it

546
0:18:28.270 --> 0:18:29.770
with the snap of the fingers how

547
0:18:29.770 --> 0:18:31.480
ridiculous is that well unfortunately

548
0:18:31.480 --> 0:18:34.270
she was in the range of lark aide who

549
0:18:34.270 --> 0:18:35.799
caused her to start orgasming so she

550
0:18:35.799 --> 0:18:37.000
couldn't really continue the fight and

551
0:18:37.000 --> 0:18:41.770
she had to retreat for now Wow now I'm

552
0:18:41.770 --> 0:18:43.330
not making this an excuse to bag on

553
0:18:43.330 --> 0:18:44.799
fairy tale I just feel like the spring

554
0:18:44.799 --> 0:18:46.900
in 12 were built to be so overpowered

555
0:18:46.900 --> 0:18:49.090
with such wacky abilities all of them

556
0:18:49.090 --> 0:18:51.130
really have the potential to be an

557
0:18:51.130 --> 0:18:52.510
absolutely trash atom even they're not

558
0:18:52.510 --> 0:18:54.250
saying that they are I'm just saying

559
0:18:54.250 --> 0:18:56.200
these characteristics are sometimes

560
0:18:56.200 --> 0:18:57.850
telling I mean there's the woman that

561
0:18:57.850 --> 0:19:00.700
can trap everyone in Tsavo stop time

562
0:19:00.700 --> 0:19:02.230
walk up to them and stop time and

563
0:19:02.230 --> 0:19:04.929
annihilate them but Natsu was so strong

564
0:19:04.929 --> 0:19:07.870
he was able to lay time on fire and

565
0:19:07.870 --> 0:19:11.020
defeat her yeah anime logic 101 don't

566
0:19:11.020 --> 0:19:13.030
make the villain too overpowered with

567
0:19:13.030 --> 0:19:14.890
such broken abilities that it doesn't

568
0:19:14.890 --> 0:19:16.210
make any sense how they're defeated one

569
0:19:16.210 --> 0:19:17.980
of the early signs for a garbage villain

570
0:19:17.980 --> 0:19:20.320
is if the ability is that broken but

571
0:19:20.320 --> 0:19:22.059
again this is not to bag on fairy tale

572
0:19:22.059 --> 0:19:24.190
at the end of seven at least in season

573
0:19:24.190 --> 0:19:26.350
one which is a series that I actually do

574
0:19:26.350 --> 0:19:28.450
like a lot just like fairy tale being

575
0:19:28.450 --> 0:19:29.980
that I'm one of the few anime youtubers

576
0:19:29.980 --> 0:19:31.630
that praises Fairy Tail for the things

577
0:19:31.630 --> 0:19:33.460
that does well hendrickson gets gray

578
0:19:33.460 --> 0:19:35.110
demon abilities and of course gray

579
0:19:35.110 --> 0:19:36.700
demons end up completely useless in the

580
0:19:36.700 --> 0:19:37.480
scheme of things

581
0:19:37.480 --> 0:19:39.159
but with his great demon ability he

582
0:19:39.159 --> 0:19:41.470
manages to use this black snow thing go

583
0:19:41.470 --> 0:19:43.270
that anyone that comes in contact with

584
0:19:43.270 --> 0:19:45.130
this black powder thing automatically

585
0:19:45.130 --> 0:19:48.429
dies yes that is a very broken power no

586
0:19:48.429 --> 0:19:50.020
he does not use it on the seven deadly

587
0:19:50.020 --> 0:19:51.730
sins he only does it on nameless

588
0:19:51.730 --> 0:19:53.649
characters that die and it's like we

589
0:19:53.649 --> 0:19:55.899
don't really care but it actually hits

590
0:19:55.899 --> 0:19:58.179
Hawk the pig the mascot of the series

591
0:19:58.179 --> 0:20:00.399
Hauk dies this is so sad good news is

592
0:20:00.399 --> 0:20:02.529
Elizabeth managed to unlock a power that

593
0:20:02.529 --> 0:20:05.230
can bring everyone dead back to life yes

594
0:20:05.230 --> 0:20:05.919
Elizabeth

595
0:20:05.919 --> 0:20:07.509
that ridiculous powerup of yours

596
0:20:07.509 --> 0:20:09.789
actually was not your fault it was

597
0:20:09.789 --> 0:20:11.350
because of the stupidly broken power of

598
0:20:11.350 --> 0:20:13.179
the anime villain net not only do we

599
0:20:13.179 --> 0:20:14.950
never see anyone else use this black

600
0:20:14.950 --> 0:20:16.539
snow powder thing again even though

601
0:20:16.539 --> 0:20:18.159
Hendrickson's power level at that point

602
0:20:18.159 --> 0:20:20.710
was like highballing 5000 and the demon

603
0:20:20.710 --> 0:20:22.960
Kang's is like five hundred thousand but

604
0:20:22.960 --> 0:20:24.460
Elizabeth never uses this revive from

605
0:20:24.460 --> 0:20:25.960
the dead thing go again either I mean

606
0:20:25.960 --> 0:20:28.090
you just can't win with stupid powers

607
0:20:28.090 --> 0:20:30.309
unless your fairy tale because most of

608
0:20:30.309 --> 0:20:32.139
them managed to get a whamon naked

609
0:20:32.139 --> 0:20:34.480
somehow and that definitely tips the

610
0:20:34.480 --> 0:20:36.639
scales to fairytales favor in the

611
0:20:36.639 --> 0:20:38.499
writing of brilliant anime villains with

612
0:20:38.499 --> 0:20:40.330
brilliant powers I hope you did enjoy

613
0:20:40.330 --> 0:20:42.249
this video hope you learned something

614
0:20:42.249 --> 0:20:44.559
new and can broaden your horizons for

615
0:20:44.559 --> 0:20:47.169
the future sharpening your mind with

616
0:20:47.169 --> 0:20:50.200
pure facts and no memes and I hope you

617
0:20:50.200 --> 0:20:52.090
could take satire because if not that

618
0:20:52.090 --> 0:20:54.220
was prolly terrible subscribe if you

619
0:20:54.220 --> 0:20:57.100
enjoyed 20,000 likes and you get 5 early

620
0:20:57.100 --> 0:20:58.600
signs of a garbage anime fight within

621
0:20:58.600 --> 0:21:19.490
the week and remember to stay weird BAM

622
0:21:19.490 --> 0:21:59.490
