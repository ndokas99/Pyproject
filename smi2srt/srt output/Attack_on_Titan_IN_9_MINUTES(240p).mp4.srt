2
0:00:02.970 --> 0:00:06.390
reminder that this scene has been

3
0:00:06.390 --> 0:00:08.040

50
0:02:21.650 --> 0:02:23.510
slightly front full of the bona fide

51
0:02:23.510 --> 0:02:25.909

52
0:02:25.909 --> 0:02:35.630
to the day into the show

53
0:02:35.630 --> 0:02:45.200

alright living anymore

62
0:03:10.420 --> 0:03:12.980
hi did you see that time what do you

63
0:03:12.980 --> 0:03:14.720
think it could possibly be Aaron Aaron

64
0:03:14.720 --> 0:03:16.520
there and probably Aaron seriously who

65
0:03:16.520 --> 0:03:17.840
else is it going to be oh come on

66
0:03:17.840 --> 0:03:19.820
that's way too up oh look it's actually

67
0:03:19.820 --> 0:03:26.690
Aaron oh fuck you all do you have

68
0:03:26.690 --> 0:03:28.700
exactly five minutes to explain yourself

69
0:03:28.700 --> 0:03:31.100
before we blow your brains out army

70
0:03:31.100 --> 0:03:32.630
everyone thinks I'm now a threat to

71
0:03:32.630 --> 0:03:34.520
humanity it's up to you to convince them

72
0:03:34.520 --> 0:03:39.790
I trust you'll know how to zoom oh okay

73
0:03:39.790 --> 0:03:42.500
maybe instead of killing our only hope

74
0:03:42.500 --> 0:03:43.940
we should use them the product oh oh

75
0:03:43.940 --> 0:03:45.680
that's a great plan sir you should

76
0:03:45.680 --> 0:03:47.870
probably tell everyone why close enough

77
0:03:47.870 --> 0:03:51.170
we're doing tank back along the tigrin

78
0:03:51.170 --> 0:03:57.380
so here is what was going to do he does

79
0:03:57.380 --> 0:03:59.360
realize he's like 200 feet up now right

80
0:03:59.360 --> 0:04:02.440
take our line and turn it upside down

81
0:04:02.440 --> 0:04:05.570
critical fellows I know he has

82
0:04:05.570 --> 0:04:07.700
absolutely no idea but that is not the

83
0:04:07.700 --> 0:04:12.100
black does anyone have any questions

84
0:04:12.100 --> 0:04:14.240
alright did you catch all that together

85
0:04:14.240 --> 0:04:15.860
and so triggered by his height himself

86
0:04:15.860 --> 0:04:17.690
so he punches himself in the face yes

87
0:04:17.690 --> 0:04:19.430
hey Aaron guess what

88
0:04:19.430 --> 0:04:24.440
you're at I bet do it do it again

89
0:04:24.440 --> 0:04:25.760
now wait we should probably get him to

90
0:04:25.760 --> 0:04:27.290
carry the bolt out of the way I think

91
0:04:27.290 --> 0:04:29.550

92
0:04:29.550 --> 0:04:34.750

that any foreign object will pose a

111
0:05:11.889 --> 0:05:14.440
great threat to us as foretold long ago

112
0:05:14.440 --> 0:05:16.690
