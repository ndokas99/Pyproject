0:00:00.170 --> 0:00:01.820
[Music]

2
0:00:01.820 --> 0:00:04.529
nothing beats a good old of a powered

3
0:00:04.529 --> 0:00:06.750
main character troupe in anime there's a

4
0:00:06.750 --> 0:00:08.820
certain enjoyment we all draw from

5
0:00:08.820 --> 0:00:11.250
watching someone be overpowered that no

6
0:00:11.250 --> 0:00:12.360
one else can touch

7
0:00:12.360 --> 0:00:15.030
it's a fantasy inside a fantasy that we

8
0:00:15.030 --> 0:00:16.920
all love to watch and thankfully the

9
0:00:16.920 --> 0:00:19.080
anime genre keeps producing amazing

10
0:00:19.080 --> 0:00:21.570
shows with overpowered emcees here's

11
0:00:21.570 --> 0:00:26.610
some of my favorites

12
0:00:26.610 --> 0:00:28.800
starting off the list at number 10 its

13
0:00:28.800 --> 0:00:31.279
Tanya from the saga of Tanya the evil

14
0:00:31.279 --> 0:00:33.989
imagine not believing in God and in this

15
0:00:33.989 --> 0:00:36.300
case a God who decides to give you one

16
0:00:36.300 --> 0:00:38.309
last chance to become a devout believer

17
0:00:38.309 --> 0:00:40.590
and turn yourself to faith by

18
0:00:40.590 --> 0:00:43.110
reincarnating you as Tanya Vonda Girish

19
0:00:43.110 --> 0:00:45.629
off a super powerful magical girl in the

20
0:00:45.629 --> 0:00:47.190
middle of an alternate universe in

21
0:00:47.190 --> 0:00:50.309
Germany during World War one the saying

22
0:00:50.309 --> 0:00:52.350
is God works in mysterious ways

23
0:00:52.350 --> 0:00:54.120
but this is more like God works in

24
0:00:54.120 --> 0:00:56.850
batshit crazy ways Thank You God though

25
0:00:56.850 --> 0:00:59.250
for giving this psychopath superhuman

26
0:00:59.250 --> 0:01:01.379
physical and magical ability such as

27
0:01:01.379 --> 0:01:03.900
flight energy manipulation and beam

28
0:01:03.900 --> 0:01:06.299
emissions and if that's not overpowered

29
0:01:06.299 --> 0:01:08.880
enough Tanya also possesses masterful

30
0:01:08.880 --> 0:01:11.250
marksmanship explosion manipulation

31
0:01:11.250 --> 0:01:13.560
making bullets explode with the power of

32
0:01:13.560 --> 0:01:16.640
a nuke telekinesis and just in case

33
0:01:16.640 --> 0:01:17.970
self-destruction

34
0:01:17.970 --> 0:01:19.710
I wonder if Jesus had all of these

35
0:01:19.710 --> 0:01:21.900
powers too he was just too much of a

36
0:01:21.900 --> 0:01:33.350
nice guy to use them

37
0:01:33.350 --> 0:01:36.020
at number nine its Tatsuya Shiba from

38
0:01:36.020 --> 0:01:38.620
the irregular at magic high school

39
0:01:38.620 --> 0:01:41.810
Tatsuya is the epitome of an overpowered

40
0:01:41.810 --> 0:01:43.700
main character he's like one of those

41
0:01:43.700 --> 0:01:45.740
perfect main characters who can do no

42
0:01:45.740 --> 0:01:48.290
wrong he's incredibly intelligent and

43
0:01:48.290 --> 0:01:50.960
part of the most elite military units he

44
0:01:50.960 --> 0:01:52.790
can read the activation sequence of a

45
0:01:52.790 --> 0:01:55.490
magic spell and recreate its raw code in

46
0:01:55.490 --> 0:01:57.530
reverse order to cancel the spell they

47
0:01:57.530 --> 0:01:59.720
call his abilities miracles and there's

48
0:01:59.720 --> 0:02:02.090
good reason for that because of Tatsuya

49
0:02:02.090 --> 0:02:04.280
is genius he can make backups of himself

50
0:02:04.280 --> 0:02:06.350
in his mind whenever his body's in

51
0:02:06.350 --> 0:02:08.270
critical condition he just thinks a

52
0:02:08.270 --> 0:02:10.220
certain thought and his physical body is

53
0:02:10.220 --> 0:02:12.020
restored to the state it was during the

54
0:02:12.020 --> 0:02:14.480
backup even when Tatsuya is on the verge

55
0:02:14.480 --> 0:02:16.730
of death he can instantly restore

56
0:02:16.730 --> 0:02:26.940
himself to a save point in the past

57
0:02:26.940 --> 0:02:29.010
moving on to number eight we have Shiki

58
0:02:29.010 --> 0:02:32.190
from the garden of sinners Shiki is from

59
0:02:32.190 --> 0:02:34.830
a family of demon hunters children born

60
0:02:34.830 --> 0:02:36.750
into the Ryoka family are generally

61
0:02:36.750 --> 0:02:38.100
raised with a male and female

62
0:02:38.100 --> 0:02:38.850
personality

63
0:02:38.850 --> 0:02:41.520
Nishiki has incredible endurance agility

64
0:02:41.520 --> 0:02:43.860
and strength she is capable of

65
0:02:43.860 --> 0:02:46.140
dispatching a horde of undead or even

66
0:02:46.140 --> 0:02:48.570
spirit light beings especially when in

67
0:02:48.570 --> 0:02:50.910
possession of a katana however what

68
0:02:50.910 --> 0:02:52.530
sensor above and beyond most if not

69
0:02:52.530 --> 0:02:55.050
every single being in her universe is

70
0:02:55.050 --> 0:02:57.810
her mystic eyes of death perception an

71
0:02:57.810 --> 0:03:00.180
ability that allows the user to perceive

72
0:03:00.180 --> 0:03:01.890
the death of something living or

73
0:03:01.890 --> 0:03:04.170
nonliving in the form of lines and dots

74
0:03:04.170 --> 0:03:06.720
on the target when cut or stabbed it

75
0:03:06.720 --> 0:03:08.520
causes the object to be sliced and

76
0:03:08.520 --> 0:03:10.470
killed with ease or in the case of the

77
0:03:10.470 --> 0:03:13.140
dots arrays of being or objects entire

78
0:03:13.140 --> 0:03:19.890
existence completely

79
0:03:19.890 --> 0:03:32.470
[Music]

80
0:03:32.470 --> 0:03:35.260
at number seven it smelly odors from the

81
0:03:35.260 --> 0:03:36.520
seven deadly sins

82
0:03:36.520 --> 0:03:38.950
many odors is the former captain of not

83
0:03:38.950 --> 0:03:41.200
just one but two of the most powerful

84
0:03:41.200 --> 0:03:43.720
groups in the world his skill in battle

85
0:03:43.720 --> 0:03:46.090
is legendary and his inherent power is

86
0:03:46.090 --> 0:03:48.760
full counter this allows him to reflect

87
0:03:48.760 --> 0:03:50.740
attacks aimed at him back at the enemy

88
0:03:50.740 --> 0:03:53.140
but would double the power so the

89
0:03:53.140 --> 0:03:55.210
stronger his opponent the stronger the

90
0:03:55.210 --> 0:03:57.400
full counter is Plus like all members of

91
0:03:57.400 --> 0:03:59.560
the demon clan he's also capable of

92
0:03:59.560 --> 0:04:01.840
manifesting the power of Darkness to

93
0:04:01.840 --> 0:04:03.820
morph into various shapes for a variety

94
0:04:03.820 --> 0:04:07.050
of purposes such as forming wings to fly

95
0:04:07.050 --> 0:04:09.700
reattaching limbs and enhancing both his

96
0:04:09.700 --> 0:04:21.730
physical and magical abilities next on

97
0:04:21.730 --> 0:04:24.760
the list is any Isshiki at number 6 the

98
0:04:24.760 --> 0:04:27.070
main character in yashiki Ichiro has a

99
0:04:27.070 --> 0:04:30.100
family that hates him his only friend is

100
0:04:30.100 --> 0:04:33.490
his dog Hanako but worry not by being in

101
0:04:33.490 --> 0:04:35.230
the right place at the right time

102
0:04:35.230 --> 0:04:37.240
he's struck by a mysterious explosion

103
0:04:37.240 --> 0:04:39.490
and gets an upgrade to his old sick body

104
0:04:39.490 --> 0:04:42.370
with an advanced mechanical body so the

105
0:04:42.370 --> 0:04:44.620
sad old man is now suddenly an amazing

106
0:04:44.620 --> 0:04:46.780
robot with all kinds of overpowered

107
0:04:46.780 --> 0:04:49.390
abilities his 58 year old brains

108
0:04:49.390 --> 0:04:51.640
replaced with a supercomputer that has

109
0:04:51.640 --> 0:04:54.010
the capability to use built-in programs

110
0:04:54.010 --> 0:04:56.410
which thankfully didn't go to a 9 year

111
0:04:56.410 --> 0:04:58.120
old because all they do is play

112
0:04:58.120 --> 0:05:00.250
fortnight on him his shell is pretty

113
0:05:00.250 --> 0:05:02.320
much indestructible and maybe it could

114
0:05:02.320 --> 0:05:03.940
be damaged by another robot but

115
0:05:03.940 --> 0:05:06.790
thankfully there aren't any other evil

116
0:05:06.790 --> 0:05:08.650
robots out there and just to name a few

117
0:05:08.650 --> 0:05:12.729
more powers enhanced senses robotic

118
0:05:12.729 --> 0:05:15.490
senses telekinesis healing properties

119
0:05:15.490 --> 0:05:18.100
full techno Kinesis technological

120
0:05:18.100 --> 0:05:20.950
adaptability arm cannon multi target

121
0:05:20.950 --> 0:05:23.470
laser self-destruction and most

122
0:05:23.470 --> 0:05:25.780
importantly the ability to shoot out of

123
0:05:25.780 --> 0:05:28.390
his finger while saying for buck buck

124
0:05:28.390 --> 0:05:37.719
buck

125
0:05:37.719 --> 0:05:40.509
and number five we have mob from mob

126
0:05:40.509 --> 0:05:43.929
cycle 100 siggy Okayama is just a kid

127
0:05:43.929 --> 0:05:45.759
trying to live a normal life you know

128
0:05:45.759 --> 0:05:48.009
maybe find a cute girl for himself play

129
0:05:48.009 --> 0:05:50.649
some sports have some friends but sadly

130
0:05:50.649 --> 0:05:53.379
for him he's socially awkward and also

131
0:05:53.379 --> 0:05:55.299
probably the most powerful espera in the

132
0:05:55.299 --> 0:05:57.699
world the abilities he suppressed since

133
0:05:57.699 --> 0:05:59.919
childhood are multiple and overpowered

134
0:05:59.919 --> 0:06:01.929
the name of the show is a looming threat

135
0:06:01.929 --> 0:06:04.989
of what will happen if he ever goes 100%

136
0:06:04.989 --> 0:06:07.149
he doesn't have full control of his

137
0:06:07.149 --> 0:06:09.129
power and as more emotional distress

138
0:06:09.129 --> 0:06:11.469
hits him the more of his power leaks out

139
0:06:11.469 --> 0:06:15.039
where 100% of it would put entire cities

140
0:06:15.039 --> 0:06:17.739
in danger even a low percentage of his

141
0:06:17.739 --> 0:06:19.509
power is pretty much unstoppable by

142
0:06:19.509 --> 0:06:21.789
anyone some of his abilities include

143
0:06:21.789 --> 0:06:24.639
telekinesis astral projection energy

144
0:06:24.639 --> 0:06:27.039
transfer and most useful in Espoo fights

145
0:06:27.039 --> 0:06:29.679
the ability to drain other Esper psychic

146
0:06:29.679 --> 0:06:30.440
energy

147
0:06:30.440 --> 0:06:38.150
[Music]

148
0:06:38.150 --> 0:06:41.400
at number four it's God or sensei from

149
0:06:41.400 --> 0:06:44.190
assassination classroom everyone has

150
0:06:44.190 --> 0:06:45.930
that one weird teacher in school but at

151
0:06:45.930 --> 0:06:48.090
least yours isn't a humanoid octopus

152
0:06:48.090 --> 0:06:49.890
whose color change is based on their

153
0:06:49.890 --> 0:06:51.900
mood that can move faster than a jet

154
0:06:51.900 --> 0:06:53.910
airplane and that plans to destroy the

155
0:06:53.910 --> 0:06:56.460
earth in one year after effectively

156
0:06:56.460 --> 0:06:58.320
taking over the world he decides to

157
0:06:58.320 --> 0:07:00.180
become a junior high school teacher and

158
0:07:00.180 --> 0:07:02.520
his students just love him calling him

159
0:07:02.520 --> 0:07:04.890
korosensei which is a combination of the

160
0:07:04.890 --> 0:07:07.800
words unkillable and teacher and oh boy

161
0:07:07.800 --> 0:07:09.660
have they tried to kill him

162
0:07:09.660 --> 0:07:11.630
every day they execute multiple

163
0:07:11.630 --> 0:07:13.470
assassination attempts on their teacher

164
0:07:13.470 --> 0:07:16.110
in order to save the world and gain 10

165
0:07:16.110 --> 0:07:17.880
billion yen from the government might I

166
0:07:17.880 --> 0:07:20.280
add chorus sensei has so many abilities

167
0:07:20.280 --> 0:07:22.740
that makes the kids jobs much harder

168
0:07:22.740 --> 0:07:25.220
including antimatter physiology

169
0:07:25.220 --> 0:07:28.530
camouflage absolute defense and energy

170
0:07:28.530 --> 0:07:32.040
laser shading skin like a snake skin

171
0:07:32.040 --> 0:07:34.080
that's indestructible and others can

172
0:07:34.080 --> 0:07:36.080
wear as an Armour regeneration

173
0:07:36.080 --> 0:07:41.930
superhuman speed and way too many more

174
0:07:41.930 --> 0:07:46.400
[Laughter]

175
0:07:46.400 --> 0:07:48.690
next on the list at number three it's

176
0:07:48.690 --> 0:07:50.400
Momonga from overlord

177
0:07:50.400 --> 0:07:52.320
as the only player character in the

178
0:07:52.320 --> 0:07:54.360
world full of NPCs he's the most

179
0:07:54.360 --> 0:07:56.670
powerful being in a Drasil thanks to his

180
0:07:56.670 --> 0:07:58.920
own devotion to the game but also his

181
0:07:58.920 --> 0:08:01.740
guild mates he's a powerful magician /

182
0:08:01.740 --> 0:08:04.380
necromancer and has all of the powerful

183
0:08:04.380 --> 0:08:06.960
items of NPCs his guild has collected at

184
0:08:06.960 --> 0:08:10.500
his disposal he has 718 spells that he's

185
0:08:10.500 --> 0:08:12.330
memorized some of which are damaging

186
0:08:12.330 --> 0:08:14.580
spells and necromancy spells that allow

187
0:08:14.580 --> 0:08:16.830
him to conjure powerful and dead beings

188
0:08:16.830 --> 0:08:19.410
the list of his abilities is too large

189
0:08:19.410 --> 0:08:25.210
to fit in any video under 2 hours long

190
0:08:25.210 --> 0:08:33.700
[Music]

191
0:08:33.700 --> 0:08:36.650
number two it's a local art from Helsing

192
0:08:36.650 --> 0:08:39.080
ultimate Alucard works for the Helsing

193
0:08:39.080 --> 0:08:41.210
organization and their main purpose is

194
0:08:41.210 --> 0:08:43.039
to fight vampires and other supernatural

195
0:08:43.039 --> 0:08:45.770
forces in fact he's probably the most

196
0:08:45.770 --> 0:08:47.690
powerful vampire out there

197
0:08:47.690 --> 0:08:50.300
he seems to be pretty much invincible he

198
0:08:50.300 --> 0:08:52.250
fights like a masochist to entertain

199
0:08:52.250 --> 0:08:54.800
himself he toys with his enemies first

200
0:08:54.800 --> 0:08:56.600
giving them a chance to carve him up and

201
0:08:56.600 --> 0:08:59.510
only then fighting back the damage he

202
0:08:59.510 --> 0:09:02.150
takes regenerates quite quickly he also

203
0:09:02.150 --> 0:09:04.250
manages to find joy in the little things

204
0:09:04.250 --> 0:09:06.500
such as killing his enemies killing his

205
0:09:06.500 --> 0:09:08.630
enemies and another hobby that includes

206
0:09:08.630 --> 0:09:10.730
killing his enemies killing is pretty

207
0:09:10.730 --> 0:09:12.260
much his favorite thing in the world and

208
0:09:12.260 --> 0:09:14.180
that's why it's good for him to have so

209
0:09:14.180 --> 0:09:16.910
many abilities such as regeneration the

210
0:09:16.910 --> 0:09:19.100
ability to manipulate blood soul

211
0:09:19.100 --> 0:09:22.040
absorption vampiric speed and many more

212
0:09:22.040 --> 0:09:24.650
he's basically like the Swiss Army knife

213
0:09:24.650 --> 0:09:27.170
of abilities if the Swiss Army knife was

214
0:09:27.170 --> 0:09:40.390
actually used just for killing and

215
0:09:40.390 --> 0:09:43.460
finally at number one it's Saitama for

216
0:09:43.460 --> 0:09:46.250
one punch man Saitama is quite obviously

217
0:09:46.250 --> 0:09:48.380
the most powerful being to exist in one

218
0:09:48.380 --> 0:09:50.600
punch man he's a main character that's

219
0:09:50.600 --> 0:09:52.550
so overpowered that he suffers from an

220
0:09:52.550 --> 0:09:54.470
existential crisis as he's now too

221
0:09:54.470 --> 0:09:56.750
powerful to gain any thrill from

222
0:09:56.750 --> 0:09:59.630
fighting form a hero for fun turned pro

223
0:09:59.630 --> 0:10:01.970
he's a bald ordinary looking man that's

224
0:10:01.970 --> 0:10:04.310
often underestimated by his enemies only

225
0:10:04.310 --> 0:10:06.590
for them to get one punch ko'd he's

226
0:10:06.590 --> 0:10:08.690
quite the mellow person but his strength

227
0:10:08.690 --> 0:10:10.370
attracts the company of many other

228
0:10:10.370 --> 0:10:12.290
powerful characters both friends and

229
0:10:12.290 --> 0:10:14.960
foes the origin of saitama's powers are

230
0:10:14.960 --> 0:10:17.810
according to him wait for it a year and

231
0:10:17.810 --> 0:10:19.340
a half of doing a hundred push-ups

232
0:10:19.340 --> 0:10:23.480
sit-ups squats and running 10 kilometers

233
0:10:23.480 --> 0:10:25.730
daily for Americans out there that's

234
0:10:25.730 --> 0:10:28.160
like 6.2 miles not the most impressive

235
0:10:28.160 --> 0:10:31.100
backstory but nevertheless a very fun
