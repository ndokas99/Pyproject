1
0:00:07.010 --> 0:00:09.930
scientists explain why left-handed

2
0:00:09.930 --> 0:00:12.740
people as smarter than the rest of us

3
0:00:12.740 --> 0:00:15.660
only about 10% of the world population

4
0:00:15.660 --> 0:00:18.840
is left-handed little Wanda nearly

5
0:00:18.840 --> 0:00:21.330
everything such as spiral notepads and

6
0:00:21.330 --> 0:00:24.029
the likes is designed to have a right

7
0:00:24.029 --> 0:00:26.849
side functioning although we've always

8
0:00:26.849 --> 0:00:29.359
thought less of left-handed people

9
0:00:29.359 --> 0:00:32.160
scientists are finally helping us to see

10
0:00:32.160 --> 0:00:33.900
them differently as they might be

11
0:00:33.900 --> 0:00:36.690
smarter than us for all we know our

12
0:00:36.690 --> 0:00:39.390
dominant hand might be influential than

13
0:00:39.390 --> 0:00:41.969
we actually know a new study published

14
0:00:41.969 --> 0:00:45.000
in frontiers in psychology pals shows

15
0:00:45.000 --> 0:00:47.129
that left-handed people might be smarter

16
0:00:47.129 --> 0:00:49.950
than right-handed folk in this video

17
0:00:49.950 --> 0:00:52.199
we'll be sharing with you some tips on

18
0:00:52.199 --> 0:00:54.870
why left-handed people are smarter than

19
0:00:54.870 --> 0:00:57.510
right-handed people if you're new here

20
0:00:57.510 --> 0:01:00.090
consider subscribing so you won't miss

21
0:01:00.090 --> 0:01:04.170
interesting videos like this first we

22
0:01:04.170 --> 0:01:06.420
need to understand what hand preference

23
0:01:06.420 --> 0:01:09.300
means it's the hand you use most for a

24
0:01:09.300 --> 0:01:12.539
range of activities for instance you may

25
0:01:12.539 --> 0:01:14.039
write with your left hand

26
0:01:14.039 --> 0:01:16.830
but brush your mouth comb your hair wave

27
0:01:16.830 --> 0:01:19.530
to people through or catch things with

28
0:01:19.530 --> 0:01:21.990
your left hand in this case you probably

29
0:01:21.990 --> 0:01:24.560
have a left hand preference

30
0:01:24.560 --> 0:01:27.899
according to IFL science people with a

31
0:01:27.899 --> 0:01:30.929
left hand preference on average have a

32
0:01:30.929 --> 0:01:33.060
more developed right brain hemisphere

33
0:01:33.060 --> 0:01:35.880
the implication of this is that they are

34
0:01:35.880 --> 0:01:37.950
better when it comes to processing and

35
0:01:37.950 --> 0:01:40.649
understanding spatial awareness and

36
0:01:40.649 --> 0:01:44.550
mental representations of objects the

37
0:01:44.550 --> 0:01:46.619
research published in frontiers in

38
0:01:46.619 --> 0:01:49.280
psychology left-handed people

39
0:01:49.280 --> 0:01:50.959
outperformed their right-handed

40
0:01:50.959 --> 0:01:53.940
counterparts in math when those tasks

41
0:01:53.940 --> 0:01:56.759
involved difficult problem solving such

42
0:01:56.759 --> 0:01:59.670
as associative mathematical functions to

43
0:01:59.670 --> 0:02:03.209
a given set of data however when the

44
0:02:03.209 --> 0:02:05.520
task wasn't so demanding for instance

45
0:02:05.520 --> 0:02:08.340
doing simple and magnetic there was no

46
0:02:08.340 --> 0:02:10.170
difference between both left-handed

47
0:02:10.170 --> 0:02:12.590
people and right-handed folks

48
0:02:12.590 --> 0:02:14.940
IFL science found out that a

49
0:02:14.940 --> 0:02:17.160
manifestation of brain function is

50
0:02:17.160 --> 0:02:19.770
therefore related to cognition

51
0:02:19.770 --> 0:02:22.040
when they did a review on handedness and

52
0:02:22.040 --> 0:02:25.350
mathematical ability for left-handed

53
0:02:25.350 --> 0:02:27.750
people they have a bigger right side of

54
0:02:27.750 --> 0:02:29.700
the brain which is responsible for

55
0:02:29.700 --> 0:02:32.390
spatial awareness and mental

56
0:02:32.390 --> 0:02:36.060
representations of objects also they

57
0:02:36.060 --> 0:02:39.000
have a larger corpus callosum the bundle

58
0:02:39.000 --> 0:02:41.310
of nerve cells connecting the two brain

59
0:02:41.310 --> 0:02:43.350
hemispheres which means that

60
0:02:43.350 --> 0:02:45.570
left-handers have enhanced connectivity

61
0:02:45.570 --> 0:02:48.570
between the two hemispheres and hence

62
0:02:48.570 --> 0:02:51.750
superior information processing making

63
0:02:51.750 --> 0:02:53.970
them faster at processing information

64
0:02:53.970 --> 0:02:57.180
than right-handed people some theories

65
0:02:57.180 --> 0:02:59.310
argue that the reason why left-handed

66
0:02:59.310 --> 0:03:01.320
people are faster at processing

67
0:03:01.320 --> 0:03:03.510
information is that we live in a world

68
0:03:03.510 --> 0:03:06.240
designed for right-handed people hence

69
0:03:06.240 --> 0:03:08.130
they are forced to use both hands

70
0:03:08.130 --> 0:03:11.300
increase in connectivity between the two

71
0:03:11.300 --> 0:03:15.450
IFL science tested 2300 students of

72
0:03:15.450 --> 0:03:17.940
different ages in primary and secondary

73
0:03:17.940 --> 0:03:21.000
schools who all asked to perform a

74
0:03:21.000 --> 0:03:23.370
variety of numerical and creative tasks

75
0:03:23.370 --> 0:03:25.910
including writing drawing and

76
0:03:25.910 --> 0:03:29.160
problem-solving the questionnaire asked

77
0:03:29.160 --> 0:03:31.590
several questions about which hand each

78
0:03:31.590 --> 0:03:34.340
individual used for different activities

79
0:03:34.340 --> 0:03:36.990
the research showed that left-handers

80
0:03:36.990 --> 0:03:39.540
outperformed the others as the math

81
0:03:39.540 --> 0:03:42.510
problems got progressively harder when

82
0:03:42.510 --> 0:03:45.150
the tasks involved simple arithmetic the

83
0:03:45.150 --> 0:03:47.280
performances of both left-handed and

84
0:03:47.280 --> 0:03:49.700
right-handed people we're the same

85
0:03:49.700 --> 0:03:53.040
also it was discovered that those who

86
0:03:53.040 --> 0:03:55.740
were extreme right-handed and performed

87
0:03:55.740 --> 0:03:57.830
every activity with their right hand

88
0:03:57.830 --> 0:04:01.320
underperformed in the analysis the

89
0:04:01.320 --> 0:04:04.200
conclusion of this test or analysis show

90
0:04:04.200 --> 0:04:05.820
that when it comes to demanding and

91
0:04:05.820 --> 0:04:08.730
complex mathematics left-handed people

92
0:04:08.730 --> 0:04:11.670
had more advantage and performed better

93
0:04:11.670 --> 0:04:14.120
than the a right-handed counterparts

94
0:04:14.120 --> 0:04:17.100
another study however concludes that

95
0:04:17.100 --> 0:04:18.859
left-handed people slightly

96
0:04:18.859 --> 0:04:21.690
underperformed in developmental measures

97
0:04:21.690 --> 0:04:24.240
but are at more advantage when it comes

98
0:04:24.240 --> 0:04:27.290
to creative processes such as drawing

99
0:04:27.290 --> 0:04:30.510
for instance the brains right side is

100
0:04:30.510 --> 0:04:32.960
associated with creativity in

101
0:04:32.960 --> 0:04:36.229
vision insight and music awareness which

102
0:04:36.229 --> 0:04:37.669
is usually the case with most

103
0:04:37.669 --> 0:04:39.770
left-handed people because the right

104
0:04:39.770 --> 0:04:41.750
side of the brain controls the left side

105
0:04:41.750 --> 0:04:45.080
of the body if you're left-handed maybe

106
0:04:45.080 --> 0:04:46.759
it's high time you stop trying to fit

107
0:04:46.759 --> 0:04:49.190
into the crowd as scientists believe you

108
0:04:49.190 --> 0:04:51.080
might be smarter than most right-handed

109
0:04:51.080 --> 0:04:59.360
