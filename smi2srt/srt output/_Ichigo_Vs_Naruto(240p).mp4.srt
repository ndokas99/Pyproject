0:00:00.030 --> 0:00:02.790
hey everybody checking 101 here okay so

2
0:00:02.790 --> 0:00:04.710
over the past couple of days I've been

3
0:00:04.710 --> 0:00:06.629
mentioning on my live streams and on my

4
0:00:06.629 --> 0:00:08.220
vlog channel and on my main channel that

5
0:00:08.220 --> 0:00:09.510
I'm going to be doing this I was going

6
0:00:09.510 --> 0:00:11.969
to do a video discussing crossover

7
0:00:11.969 --> 0:00:15.570
battles and mainly uh this was confirmed

8
0:00:15.570 --> 0:00:17.490
to me yesterday when I uploaded a video

9
0:00:17.490 --> 0:00:20.820
of a very seemingly innocent v-log on my

10
0:00:20.820 --> 0:00:24.180
channel where me and my friend Phil just

11
0:00:24.180 --> 0:00:26.310
went along shopping you know just like

12
0:00:26.310 --> 0:00:28.349
okay this is you know I I haven't shown

13
0:00:28.349 --> 0:00:30.990
a lot of other people in my v-log so you

14
0:00:30.990 --> 0:00:32.578
know there you go I'll just post this

15
0:00:32.578 --> 0:00:34.710
very innocent just thing maybe I'll get

16
0:00:34.710 --> 0:00:36.510
a few yucks out of it yeah and then I

17
0:00:36.510 --> 0:00:38.550
discovered I knew this already I really

18
0:00:38.550 --> 0:00:41.129
did but just to confirm the fact that

19
0:00:41.129 --> 0:00:43.770
even if it's a video that doesn't have

20
0:00:43.770 --> 0:00:46.559
anything to do with anime if you so much

21
0:00:46.559 --> 0:00:49.620
as even mention a crossover battle and

22
0:00:49.620 --> 0:00:52.289
who you think would win or lose who

23
0:00:52.289 --> 0:00:55.440
would win ichigo or naruto this is a

24
0:00:55.440 --> 0:00:57.539
main issue right now that might be

25
0:00:57.539 --> 0:01:02.539
making a series about this naruto

26
0:01:02.539 --> 0:01:05.880
comment section fucking extravaganza ha

27
0:01:05.880 --> 0:01:07.890
ha never ceases to amaze me actually it

28
0:01:07.890 --> 0:01:09.299
kind of does you guys really scare me

29
0:01:09.299 --> 0:01:11.729
getsuga tensho is millions times

30
0:01:11.729 --> 0:01:14.520
stronger than all Naruto's Rasengan

31
0:01:14.520 --> 0:01:17.640
Barto Rasengan is two weeks so ross and

32
0:01:17.640 --> 0:01:19.619
shuriken Rasengan and the rest of them

33
0:01:19.619 --> 0:01:20.549
are pointless

34
0:01:20.549 --> 0:01:23.430
also staged mode is crap in addition

35
0:01:23.430 --> 0:01:26.640
ichigo has blue vein do you know what

36
0:01:26.640 --> 0:01:29.000
that even is that is crazy defense

37
0:01:29.000 --> 0:01:31.920
ichigo with the raw power beats Naruto

38
0:01:31.920 --> 0:01:34.170
just like he beat Aizen normal bankai

39
0:01:34.170 --> 0:01:37.020
ichigo vs all power off a Naruto Ichigo

40
0:01:37.020 --> 0:01:41.130
is dead not okay uh well as you can see

41
0:01:41.130 --> 0:01:43.409
the resounding opinion is that Ichigo

42
0:01:43.409 --> 0:01:46.229
would steamroll Naruto in an instant and

43
0:01:46.229 --> 0:01:49.200
the problem here is in the video and my

44
0:01:49.200 --> 0:01:50.820
personal opinion on the matter is that

45
0:01:50.820 --> 0:01:54.060
Naruto would in fact win so and there's

46
0:01:54.060 --> 0:01:55.979
also a comment to is on a previous video

47
0:01:55.979 --> 0:01:57.780
and I misplaced it somewhere but it

48
0:01:57.780 --> 0:01:59.700
essentially came up with two points and

49
0:01:59.700 --> 0:02:00.780
that's what kind of got me on this

50
0:02:00.780 --> 0:02:04.490
warpath hole to begin with that Naruto

51
0:02:04.490 --> 0:02:06.930
cannot is not a spiritually aware being

52
0:02:06.930 --> 0:02:08.250
and therefore would not be able to see

53
0:02:08.250 --> 0:02:09.869
Ichigo and along with this Ichigo is

54
0:02:09.869 --> 0:02:12.360
able to fly so you know I've tried maybe

55
0:02:12.360 --> 0:02:12.700
this

56
0:02:12.700 --> 0:02:13.900
this vlog and I just thought you know

57
0:02:13.900 --> 0:02:15.129
what I'm just gonna put a vlog out there

58
0:02:15.129 --> 0:02:16.840
people may be seein to see this little

59
0:02:16.840 --> 0:02:17.920
bit of my own life and instead the

60
0:02:17.920 --> 0:02:21.069
comments section is magnetized toward

61
0:02:21.069 --> 0:02:24.010
this I'm tired I'm done I'm doing this

62
0:02:24.010 --> 0:02:25.209
video now I was going to give a little

63
0:02:25.209 --> 0:02:26.680
bit more time to see how maybe I could

64
0:02:26.680 --> 0:02:28.750
pan out because the thing with crossover

65
0:02:28.750 --> 0:02:31.720
battles is pretty much everybody in the

66
0:02:31.720 --> 0:02:33.099
anime manga community has at least

67
0:02:33.099 --> 0:02:35.230
mentioned it or has a separate series on

68
0:02:35.230 --> 0:02:37.450
it or other videos on YouTube that you

69
0:02:37.450 --> 0:02:38.530
can look into it and I thought well

70
0:02:38.530 --> 0:02:40.090
there's no point me doing it because now

71
0:02:40.090 --> 0:02:42.310
all this is going to result in is just

72
0:02:42.310 --> 0:02:44.530
me saying who would win who would lose a

73
0:02:44.530 --> 0:02:46.540
bunch of people in the comments some

74
0:02:46.540 --> 0:02:48.190
agree with me most of them probably not

75
0:02:48.190 --> 0:02:51.160
leaving an entire you know like a

76
0:02:51.160 --> 0:02:53.650
hundred page freaking arguments with

77
0:02:53.650 --> 0:02:55.480
somebody else on why Ichigo or Naruto

78
0:02:55.480 --> 0:02:58.360
would win so it just seems more trouble

79
0:02:58.360 --> 0:02:59.980
than it's worth but you know I start to

80
0:02:59.980 --> 0:03:03.340
think that you know that's actually a

81
0:03:03.340 --> 0:03:05.230
good thing that there's multiple

82
0:03:05.230 --> 0:03:06.760
different opinions on YouTube because

83
0:03:06.760 --> 0:03:08.709
that way if you don't like the way I'm

84
0:03:08.709 --> 0:03:10.150
presenting it because I'm gonna do it my

85
0:03:10.150 --> 0:03:11.590
own way I'm gonna have my own rules and

86
0:03:11.590 --> 0:03:13.390
regulations I'm gonna have my own little

87
0:03:13.390 --> 0:03:14.950
way I'm gonna do this if you don't agree

88
0:03:14.950 --> 0:03:16.569
with me then go watch somebody else you

89
0:03:16.569 --> 0:03:18.310
do agree with but that's a good thing

90
0:03:18.310 --> 0:03:19.480
that there's different opinions because

91
0:03:19.480 --> 0:03:21.970
a lot of this stuff is variable factors

92
0:03:21.970 --> 0:03:24.430
stuff that is not concrete stuff that

93
0:03:24.430 --> 0:03:26.049
has never been confirmed and never will

94
0:03:26.049 --> 0:03:27.910
be confirmed no matter how much you

95
0:03:27.910 --> 0:03:30.459
think Naruto would freaking own Ichigo

96
0:03:30.459 --> 0:03:33.010
or Ichigo would stop Naruto's freaking

97
0:03:33.010 --> 0:03:34.750
Fox form into the freakin dirt with

98
0:03:34.750 --> 0:03:35.859
getsuga tensho

99
0:03:35.859 --> 0:03:39.700
there is absolutely no final answer the

100
0:03:39.700 --> 0:03:41.859
only conceivable way that would happen

101
0:03:41.859 --> 0:03:44.380
is if t-take Kubo creator of bleach and

102
0:03:44.380 --> 0:03:46.810
Masashi Kishimoto creator of Naruto

103
0:03:46.810 --> 0:03:48.970
got together mostly up there not own

104
0:03:48.970 --> 0:03:51.250
free will and by droves of fans forcing

105
0:03:51.250 --> 0:03:52.870
them into a room together to write a

106
0:03:52.870 --> 0:03:55.209
definitive manga chapter where Ichigo

107
0:03:55.209 --> 0:03:58.030
and Naruto fight to the death that's the

108
0:03:58.030 --> 0:03:59.440
only way that's going to go down and I

109
0:03:59.440 --> 0:04:00.639
don't think that's ever going to go down

110
0:04:00.639 --> 0:04:02.560
because no Noman gonca wants that no

111
0:04:02.560 --> 0:04:04.510
Mongkok i wants to get it together with

112
0:04:04.510 --> 0:04:06.160
another one be like hey you want to make

113
0:04:06.160 --> 0:04:07.569
a series where my character gets the

114
0:04:07.569 --> 0:04:09.160
shit kicked out of him by yours you know

115
0:04:09.160 --> 0:04:11.260
so your mongo getting way more views and

116
0:04:11.260 --> 0:04:12.519
mine will get ridiculed for all eternity

117
0:04:12.519 --> 0:04:15.010
I mean look at the look at the one piece

118
0:04:15.010 --> 0:04:17.560
and Torico crossovers yeah we saw fights

119
0:04:17.560 --> 0:04:19.180
between one piece and Torico and even

120
0:04:19.180 --> 0:04:20.890
the goq in the Dragon Ball Z crossover

121
0:04:20.890 --> 0:04:23.020
with Goku but it wasn't like a serious

122
0:04:23.020 --> 0:04:24.370
fight I mean it's not going to come out

123
0:04:24.370 --> 0:04:24.680
with

124
0:04:24.680 --> 0:04:26.300
be dead on the ground and Goku Super

125
0:04:26.300 --> 0:04:27.949
Saiyan 3 triumphant covered in his blood

126
0:04:27.949 --> 0:04:30.009
you know it's going to be equal so

127
0:04:30.009 --> 0:04:31.729
that's the problem when you have

128
0:04:31.729 --> 0:04:34.280
official crossovers and you know like I

129
0:04:34.280 --> 0:04:35.750
said the problems with fandom crossovers

130
0:04:35.750 --> 0:04:38.150
are the variable factors so there we go

131
0:04:38.150 --> 0:04:40.070
I'm going to do this I wrote down my

132
0:04:40.070 --> 0:04:41.990
little cheat sheet of all the abilities

133
0:04:41.990 --> 0:04:43.610
and everything I thought that each of

134
0:04:43.610 --> 0:04:46.870
them have to attack defense speed

135
0:04:46.870 --> 0:04:48.949
augmentation abilities and other

136
0:04:48.949 --> 0:04:51.289
miscellaneous abilities so that's five

137
0:04:51.289 --> 0:04:53.630
crucial groups we're talking about here

138
0:04:53.630 --> 0:04:56.449
now once again I'm gonna do this my own

139
0:04:56.449 --> 0:04:58.280
way you're probably going to UM up it

140
0:04:58.280 --> 0:04:59.930
for opinions I'm open for people saying

141
0:04:59.930 --> 0:05:01.099
oh maybe you should do this instead of

142
0:05:01.099 --> 0:05:02.630
this but I know I'm going to get

143
0:05:02.630 --> 0:05:04.669
comments they're saying like oh well you

144
0:05:04.669 --> 0:05:06.560
did this instead of this so therefore

145
0:05:06.560 --> 0:05:09.020
your entire fight is not even viable

146
0:05:09.020 --> 0:05:11.630
because the way you did it this is the

147
0:05:11.630 --> 0:05:13.789
way I see the fairness okay first thing

148
0:05:13.789 --> 0:05:16.310
we do before we even discuss actual

149
0:05:16.310 --> 0:05:18.199
Ichigo Naruto in terms of fighting

150
0:05:18.199 --> 0:05:20.240
ability and characters is the area in

151
0:05:20.240 --> 0:05:22.699
which they're fighting and other stuff

152
0:05:22.699 --> 0:05:24.139
we have to sort out by the way because

153
0:05:24.139 --> 0:05:25.580
these two characters are from different

154
0:05:25.580 --> 0:05:27.530
universes they had draw their power from

155
0:05:27.530 --> 0:05:29.539
different sources ichigo uses reaction

156
0:05:29.539 --> 0:05:32.270
rate reishi Naruto uses chakra and the

157
0:05:32.270 --> 0:05:33.830
nine tails Fox and everything so that's

158
0:05:33.830 --> 0:05:35.990
where his powers were based on so we

159
0:05:35.990 --> 0:05:37.550
cannot have them fight we can't just

160
0:05:37.550 --> 0:05:39.199
have Ichigo popping in the Naruto's

161
0:05:39.199 --> 0:05:41.330
world or vice-versa we have to make a

162
0:05:41.330 --> 0:05:43.070
neutral universe that's where the

163
0:05:43.070 --> 0:05:45.500
variables come into play here so neutral

164
0:05:45.500 --> 0:05:47.750
universe they both just appear in the

165
0:05:47.750 --> 0:05:49.760
universe okay in this universe let's

166
0:05:49.760 --> 0:05:51.470
just say physics apply the same way

167
0:05:51.470 --> 0:05:53.240
Naruto can still use chakra and gather

168
0:05:53.240 --> 0:05:55.460
chakra ichigo still has this reishi and

169
0:05:55.460 --> 0:05:57.020
can still use reishi based attacks

170
0:05:57.020 --> 0:05:59.659
another major crucial issue here is that

171
0:05:59.659 --> 0:06:01.669
Naruto is not as spiritually aware being

172
0:06:01.669 --> 0:06:03.860
there for Ichigo with freaking own him

173
0:06:03.860 --> 0:06:05.599
because Naruto will not be able to see

174
0:06:05.599 --> 0:06:07.699
him it is true that Naruto has the

175
0:06:07.699 --> 0:06:09.979
ability to sense emotions through his

176
0:06:09.979 --> 0:06:11.870
nine tails chakra and that would make

177
0:06:11.870 --> 0:06:13.039
sense that you would be able to sense

178
0:06:13.039 --> 0:06:15.710
his emotion but at the same time not

179
0:06:15.710 --> 0:06:17.060
being able to see him would be a crucial

180
0:06:17.060 --> 0:06:19.550
disadvantage here's what I have to say

181
0:06:19.550 --> 0:06:20.900
about that and this is probably where a

182
0:06:20.900 --> 0:06:22.150
lot of people are going to get mad at me

183
0:06:22.150 --> 0:06:24.409
you have to look at each of their

184
0:06:24.409 --> 0:06:27.050
personalities Ichigo and Naruto are both

185
0:06:27.050 --> 0:06:29.000
 very typical Shonen hero in the sense

186
0:06:29.000 --> 0:06:30.740
that they like to have a fair fight they

187
0:06:30.740 --> 0:06:32.270
don't like to fight anyone against the

188
0:06:32.270 --> 0:06:34.130
odds or you know like anything that's a

189
0:06:34.130 --> 0:06:36.200
majorly tip to their favor I mean

190
0:06:36.200 --> 0:06:37.969
they'll take a chance --is of off

191
0:06:37.969 --> 0:06:39.889
tunity in battle you know and eat when

192
0:06:39.889 --> 0:06:42.259
like if eysan were to you know like you

193
0:06:42.259 --> 0:06:43.999
know if Ichigo were to hit eyes and he

194
0:06:43.999 --> 0:06:45.469
gets knocked into a building ichigo's

195
0:06:45.469 --> 0:06:46.999
not going to be you know oh well I'm

196
0:06:46.999 --> 0:06:48.259
gonna wait him to get back up well

197
0:06:48.259 --> 0:06:49.429
sometimes he does that but I'm not going

198
0:06:49.429 --> 0:06:50.419
to wait for him to get back up I'm gonna

199
0:06:50.419 --> 0:06:51.319
charge right at him

200
0:06:51.319 --> 0:06:53.269
but in terms of the actual basis of the

201
0:06:53.269 --> 0:06:55.099
fight look when ichigo fought against

202
0:06:55.099 --> 0:06:57.259
doki aura he went hollow form ripped off

203
0:06:57.259 --> 0:06:59.059
ouki auras arm and leg after he regained

204
0:06:59.059 --> 0:07:01.489
consciousness he offered Farooqi aura to

205
0:07:01.489 --> 0:07:03.499
rip off his arm and leg so it would be a

206
0:07:03.499 --> 0:07:06.019
fair fight so you really have to think

207
0:07:06.019 --> 0:07:09.559
to yourself Ichigo just saw Naruto do

208
0:07:09.559 --> 0:07:11.029
you really think Ichigo would be like

209
0:07:11.029 --> 0:07:13.009
huh look at that blonde idiot he thinks

210
0:07:13.009 --> 0:07:14.779
he's such a badass he can't even see me

211
0:07:14.779 --> 0:07:16.039
I'm just gonna walk up to him and slit

212
0:07:16.039 --> 0:07:18.110
his frickin throat with my sword Ichigo

213
0:07:18.110 --> 0:07:19.069
would never do that

214
0:07:19.069 --> 0:07:21.829
so in terms of a fight between Ichigo

215
0:07:21.829 --> 0:07:23.689
and Naruto and not Naruto not being able

216
0:07:23.689 --> 0:07:26.599
to see Ichigo that wouldn't even be a

217
0:07:26.599 --> 0:07:28.759
fight and I don't mean that that would

218
0:07:28.759 --> 0:07:29.869
not be a fight as Ichigo would

219
0:07:29.869 --> 0:07:32.209
immediately 100% win I mean Ichigo would

220
0:07:32.209 --> 0:07:34.099
not fight Naruto in those conditions

221
0:07:34.099 --> 0:07:36.860
that just would not happen in this

222
0:07:36.860 --> 0:07:39.769
neutral universe Naruto can see Ichigo

223
0:07:39.769 --> 0:07:42.050
vice versa they could both see each

224
0:07:42.050 --> 0:07:44.809
other's abilities now another major kind

225
0:07:44.809 --> 0:07:45.860
of crucial thing we have to determine

226
0:07:45.860 --> 0:07:49.879
here is the ability of reishi and chakra

227
0:07:49.879 --> 0:07:52.009
because Naruto and Ichigo both have a

228
0:07:52.009 --> 0:07:54.800
separate power sources and people are

229
0:07:54.800 --> 0:07:56.389
going to wonder like okay well you know

230
0:07:56.389 --> 0:07:58.369
does reiatsu you know can Ichigo since

231
0:07:58.369 --> 0:08:00.229
Naruto because he doesn't have reiatsu

232
0:08:00.229 --> 0:08:02.659
or is in chakra okay both of them at the

233
0:08:02.659 --> 0:08:04.519
same time you gotta have to look at this

234
0:08:04.519 --> 0:08:06.379
Naruto and Ichigo aren't really good at

235
0:08:06.379 --> 0:08:08.209
sensing the respective energies Ichigo

236
0:08:08.209 --> 0:08:10.009
is never very good at sensing reiatsu to

237
0:08:10.009 --> 0:08:10.579
begin with

238
0:08:10.579 --> 0:08:13.339
Naruto without without the nine tails or

239
0:08:13.339 --> 0:08:15.619
sage mode chakras help was not able to

240
0:08:15.619 --> 0:08:17.389
sense he's not a sensory-type ninja he's

241
0:08:17.389 --> 0:08:18.860
not able to just being like he's not

242
0:08:18.860 --> 0:08:20.360
caring or any money as I kind of like oh

243
0:08:20.360 --> 0:08:22.249
there's no ninja over there he's never

244
0:08:22.249 --> 0:08:24.379
been able to do that with sage mode his

245
0:08:24.379 --> 0:08:25.699
senses are heightened to insane

246
0:08:25.699 --> 0:08:27.979
superhuman degrees and he can certainly

247
0:08:27.979 --> 0:08:29.719
hear things and see things he's never

248
0:08:29.719 --> 0:08:31.519
been able to see before and through the

249
0:08:31.519 --> 0:08:32.899
nine tails chakra he's able to sense

250
0:08:32.899 --> 0:08:34.550
emotions but on his own

251
0:08:34.550 --> 0:08:36.379
Naruto is not able to sense chakra so

252
0:08:36.379 --> 0:08:38.539
that doesn't even apply anyway so the

253
0:08:38.539 --> 0:08:40.339
whole sensing issue that that doesn't

254
0:08:40.339 --> 0:08:43.008
even have to apply so I think that's

255
0:08:43.008 --> 0:08:44.300
everything all the nitpicks we have to

256
0:08:44.300 --> 0:08:45.589
get out of the way in terms of how the

257
0:08:45.589 --> 0:08:47.269
fight would be set up so neutral

258
0:08:47.269 --> 0:08:49.550
universe Naruto can see Ichigo

259
0:08:49.550 --> 0:08:50.890
sensing is not really an issue

260
0:08:50.890 --> 0:08:52.630
because of the they're both in ability

261
0:08:52.630 --> 0:08:54.910
they really do it to begin with so now

262
0:08:54.910 --> 0:08:57.790
let's get to the actual how the fight

263
0:08:57.790 --> 0:09:00.579
would start off or play off now you know

264
0:09:00.579 --> 0:09:02.649
I was going to think of how to do this

265
0:09:02.649 --> 0:09:04.690
if Ichigo Naruto we're kind of kind of

266
0:09:04.690 --> 0:09:06.820
start off in their own you know respect

267
0:09:06.820 --> 0:09:08.890
like normal state Ichigo shikai and then

268
0:09:08.890 --> 0:09:11.470
if the fight increases not Ichigo jumps

269
0:09:11.470 --> 0:09:13.899
to bankai but really how many times have

270
0:09:13.899 --> 0:09:15.250
we seen in the series even up to this

271
0:09:15.250 --> 0:09:17.279
point we've seen in the series that

272
0:09:17.279 --> 0:09:19.360
Ichigo just kind of goes ball and Kai

273
0:09:19.360 --> 0:09:21.190
right away where he's been in bankai for

274
0:09:21.190 --> 0:09:23.050
a period of time and you know even with

275
0:09:23.050 --> 0:09:24.459
the war arc gnar has been pretty much

276
0:09:24.459 --> 0:09:26.290
stuck in the ninetails clock cloaked

277
0:09:26.290 --> 0:09:28.120
form for pretty much close to 100

278
0:09:28.120 --> 0:09:30.519
chapters if that so I'm just going to

279
0:09:30.519 --> 0:09:31.660
say off the bat

280
0:09:31.660 --> 0:09:33.490
let's just say Naruto goes in the nine

281
0:09:33.490 --> 0:09:35.310
tails cloak form because he's able to

282
0:09:35.310 --> 0:09:38.350
control the to be basically him in

283
0:09:38.350 --> 0:09:40.899
Kurama or on even footing right now so

284
0:09:40.899 --> 0:09:42.130
he would be able to access the nine

285
0:09:42.130 --> 0:09:43.810
tails chakra no problem Ichigo isn't

286
0:09:43.810 --> 0:09:45.310
that depth at bankai so he would go

287
0:09:45.310 --> 0:09:47.470
bankai directly as for the current

288
0:09:47.470 --> 0:09:48.820
versions that were fighting or what

289
0:09:48.820 --> 0:09:50.440
point in the time frame I'm going at I'm

290
0:09:50.440 --> 0:09:52.570
going after them both as recent as

291
0:09:52.570 --> 0:09:54.550
humanly possible so in terms of Naruto

292
0:09:54.550 --> 0:09:56.380
he's able to use the nine tails chakra

293
0:09:56.380 --> 0:09:58.570
he's able to transform into Quran on him

294
0:09:58.570 --> 0:09:59.769
and Kurama can communicate back and

295
0:09:59.769 --> 0:10:02.079
forth Sage Mode nights those cloak all

296
0:10:02.079 --> 0:10:04.300
that stuff he's able to do Ichigo I had

297
0:10:04.300 --> 0:10:05.620
to kind of twist around a little bit

298
0:10:05.620 --> 0:10:06.940
because his powers are very sketchy

299
0:10:06.940 --> 0:10:09.339
right now I know he's a Quincy and a lot

300
0:10:09.339 --> 0:10:10.420
of people are thinking he's going to

301
0:10:10.420 --> 0:10:12.850
whip out like a black Quincy Bo and you

302
0:10:12.850 --> 0:10:14.410
know do all that crazy shit but we don't

303
0:10:14.410 --> 0:10:16.959
know any of that yet um I had I know

304
0:10:16.959 --> 0:10:18.610
he's getting a new sword soon from the

305
0:10:18.610 --> 0:10:20.050
Maya but we had to go back because we

306
0:10:20.050 --> 0:10:21.550
don't know what that new sword is going

307
0:10:21.550 --> 0:10:22.870
to be or what it's going to look like or

308
0:10:22.870 --> 0:10:24.250
how its powers are going to be different

309
0:10:24.250 --> 0:10:26.260
from his current bankai so we're going

310
0:10:26.260 --> 0:10:28.600
back with his original bankai after it

311
0:10:28.600 --> 0:10:30.370
was restored by Rukia so the one that

312
0:10:30.370 --> 0:10:32.380
hash fall broke essentially so we're

313
0:10:32.380 --> 0:10:35.170
going with post time skip Ichigo before

314
0:10:35.170 --> 0:10:37.420
his sword was broken and we're going

315
0:10:37.420 --> 0:10:39.040
with current Naruto in terms of the

316
0:10:39.040 --> 0:10:41.620
chapters alright so just to clarify that

317
0:10:41.620 --> 0:10:43.600
ready to go with the actual comparison

318
0:10:43.600 --> 0:10:45.459
between their attacks and defense speed

319
0:10:45.459 --> 0:10:48.029
augments and other abilities I got my

320
0:10:48.029 --> 0:10:50.500
bleach wristband there in my deidara

321
0:10:50.500 --> 0:10:52.390
Akatsuki ring which is actually on the

322
0:10:52.390 --> 0:10:54.160
right finger I believe I think it is I

323
0:10:54.160 --> 0:10:56.860
hope okay so in terms of attacks let's

324
0:10:56.860 --> 0:10:58.120
just go down the attack list here

325
0:10:58.120 --> 0:11:00.430
ichigo's got gets a good 10 show he's

326
0:11:00.430 --> 0:11:01.690
got enhanced strength through reiatsu

327
0:11:01.690 --> 0:11:03.610
and his training he has bankai with an

328
0:11:03.610 --> 0:11:04.840
enhanced black getsuga

329
0:11:04.840 --> 0:11:06.760
he's got hollow masks I know we haven't

330
0:11:06.760 --> 0:11:08.440
seen each ego uses hollow mass since the

331
0:11:08.440 --> 0:11:08.980
time-skip

332
0:11:08.980 --> 0:11:10.990
but it's such a massive chunk of his

333
0:11:10.990 --> 0:11:12.790
powers and if I didn't mention it I'd be

334
0:11:12.790 --> 0:11:15.040
under more scrutiny and plus we saw in

335
0:11:15.040 --> 0:11:17.650
the last chapter with the Itachi that he

336
0:11:17.650 --> 0:11:19.990
was selecting one that resembled very

337
0:11:19.990 --> 0:11:21.760
closely to his hollow abilities so let's

338
0:11:21.760 --> 0:11:24.040
just say hallo mask in the sense of the

339
0:11:24.040 --> 0:11:25.870
hala mask he used against eyes and with

340
0:11:25.870 --> 0:11:28.089
the the two lines there he also has a

341
0:11:28.089 --> 0:11:30.070
focus get-together that he can channel

342
0:11:30.070 --> 0:11:31.330
into his arm when he fought with Yura

343
0:11:31.330 --> 0:11:33.730
and now the two abilities that

344
0:11:33.730 --> 0:11:36.040
everyone's gonna well maybe ones not so

345
0:11:36.040 --> 0:11:38.080
big one is the cero but he's only able

346
0:11:38.080 --> 0:11:40.000
to use that info hollow form I'll get to

347
0:11:40.000 --> 0:11:41.710
that when we get more into you know

348
0:11:41.710 --> 0:11:43.570
later down the line in the fight I know

349
0:11:43.570 --> 0:11:45.400
other visored such as Shinji and Masha

350
0:11:45.400 --> 0:11:46.990
ro can just do a Sarah whenever they

351
0:11:46.990 --> 0:11:48.580
want just with their masks ichigo's

352
0:11:48.580 --> 0:11:50.140
never been displayed that ability he's

353
0:11:50.140 --> 0:11:51.640
never shown trying to learn how to do a

354
0:11:51.640 --> 0:11:53.529
cero so let's just say you can't use a

355
0:11:53.529 --> 0:11:55.390
Sarah unless he's a full holo and the

356
0:11:55.390 --> 0:11:58.750
other thing is his final gets to get ten

357
0:11:58.750 --> 0:12:02.080
show and that's another thing that a lot

358
0:12:02.080 --> 0:12:04.650
of people are saying right away that

359
0:12:04.650 --> 0:12:07.390
ichigo's final getsugatensho would

360
0:12:07.390 --> 0:12:09.700
immediately be able to split Naruto in

361
0:12:09.700 --> 0:12:12.160
half and that's pretty much it right

362
0:12:12.160 --> 0:12:13.960
there let's get that out of the way

363
0:12:13.960 --> 0:12:17.320
right now okay number one we're not even

364
0:12:17.320 --> 0:12:18.430
sure if he can do it again

365
0:12:18.430 --> 0:12:20.710
so I mean you probably can but we're not

366
0:12:20.710 --> 0:12:22.600
even sure if he can number two what he

367
0:12:22.600 --> 0:12:24.730
really want to do it again and we have

368
0:12:24.730 --> 0:12:27.640
to think about this Ichigo knew he could

369
0:12:27.640 --> 0:12:29.080
not defeat Aizen he was pretty much

370
0:12:29.080 --> 0:12:30.310
guaranteed he cannot defeat Aizen

371
0:12:30.310 --> 0:12:32.560
although after he trained with ition in

372
0:12:32.560 --> 0:12:34.900
the dong guy and he you know met tensa

373
0:12:34.900 --> 0:12:36.430
zangetsu and everything it kind of was

374
0:12:36.430 --> 0:12:37.810
apparent that he was able to basically

375
0:12:37.810 --> 0:12:39.250
kick the shit out of Aizen without using

376
0:12:39.250 --> 0:12:40.450
Vonnegut's content show but whatever

377
0:12:40.450 --> 0:12:42.460
let's just say you know what do you

378
0:12:42.460 --> 0:12:43.810
really want to waste all of his powers

379
0:12:43.810 --> 0:12:46.330
on a one-shot and number number three he

380
0:12:46.330 --> 0:12:48.220
doesn't like the Indian the exact

381
0:12:48.220 --> 0:12:50.709
purpose of the power how it works it's

382
0:12:50.709 --> 0:12:52.720
never been really shown exactly the

383
0:12:52.720 --> 0:12:54.910
whole mechanics of this ability like we

384
0:12:54.910 --> 0:12:56.830
know you know he turns into fool gets

385
0:12:56.830 --> 0:12:59.200
ago mode raises his sword off uses mu

386
0:12:59.200 --> 0:13:02.709
gets and then just darkness comes out of

387
0:13:02.709 --> 0:13:04.870
nowhere and just splits everything right

388
0:13:04.870 --> 0:13:07.870
down the middle I mean can it be dodged

389
0:13:07.870 --> 0:13:10.420
can it be you know evaded or I'm sure it

390
0:13:10.420 --> 0:13:11.860
can't be blocked just because of the raw

391
0:13:11.860 --> 0:13:15.730
power but I mean if he misses with that

392
0:13:15.730 --> 0:13:18.130
technique it's over I mean I mean it's

393
0:13:18.130 --> 0:13:18.649
clear I mean

394
0:13:18.649 --> 0:13:20.029
can you can't even say that it's

395
0:13:20.029 --> 0:13:22.129
unavailable because we saw in that

396
0:13:22.129 --> 0:13:23.600
chapter it just cuts everything right

397
0:13:23.600 --> 0:13:26.600
down the middle so therefore by logic if

398
0:13:26.600 --> 0:13:28.910
you were not in the direct path of the

399
0:13:28.910 --> 0:13:30.529
attack if you were not in this point

400
0:13:30.529 --> 0:13:33.499
that was split in half then you would be

401
0:13:33.499 --> 0:13:35.089
technically evading the attack and

402
0:13:35.089 --> 0:13:37.519
Ichigo would be out of power so I'm just

403
0:13:37.519 --> 0:13:39.439
gonna say he wouldn't use the final

404
0:13:39.439 --> 0:13:41.629
getsugatensho and then Robert Robert

405
0:13:41.629 --> 0:13:43.160
Robert how dare you whatever okay let's

406
0:13:43.160 --> 0:13:45.529
say so you know no final get to get in

407
0:13:45.529 --> 0:13:48.889
show and Sarah only a full hallo okay so

408
0:13:48.889 --> 0:13:50.480
those are basically all of ichigo's

409
0:13:50.480 --> 0:13:52.519
offensive abilities now let's look how

410
0:13:52.519 --> 0:13:54.860
they stack up to Naruto's Naruto has

411
0:13:54.860 --> 0:13:57.230
shadow clones he has a Rasengan in

412
0:13:57.230 --> 0:13:59.290
multiple forms he has massive Rasengan

413
0:13:59.290 --> 0:14:01.699
Rasengan Rasen shuriken planetary

414
0:14:01.699 --> 0:14:04.399
Rasengan twin rasen shuriken Sage Mode

415
0:14:04.399 --> 0:14:07.429
Rasengan twin Rasengan normal it says so

416
0:14:07.429 --> 0:14:09.319
he has multiple variations of the same

417
0:14:09.319 --> 0:14:11.420
technique so we'll get back to that he

418
0:14:11.420 --> 0:14:13.759
also has a sage mode and he also has

419
0:14:13.759 --> 0:14:15.079
summoning abilities which he barely

420
0:14:15.079 --> 0:14:16.910
rarely uses anymore and he also has

421
0:14:16.910 --> 0:14:18.829
ninja tools he has you know we've seen

422
0:14:18.829 --> 0:14:20.149
after the time-skip he just keeps

423
0:14:20.149 --> 0:14:21.709
Scrolls on him so he's able to just you

424
0:14:21.709 --> 0:14:23.329
know pop out a giant shuriken whenever

425
0:14:23.329 --> 0:14:25.399
he wants to all right along with this

426
0:14:25.399 --> 0:14:27.199
you know nara ichigo would of course

427
0:14:27.199 --> 0:14:30.350
have a sort of obviously so here's what

428
0:14:30.350 --> 0:14:32.209
we get into another major issue from the

429
0:14:32.209 --> 0:14:33.499
comments that I've been reading anyway

430
0:14:33.499 --> 0:14:35.120
pretty much everyone said well not

431
0:14:35.120 --> 0:14:36.319
everybody but pretty much the main

432
0:14:36.319 --> 0:14:38.870
consensus is you know ichigo's one get

433
0:14:38.870 --> 0:14:41.480
touka tensho would be able to destroy

434
0:14:41.480 --> 0:14:44.269
Naruto's Rasengan no matter what like

435
0:14:44.269 --> 0:14:46.429
the power wouldn't even compare the way

436
0:14:46.429 --> 0:14:49.279
I look at it is this way yes if Ichigo

437
0:14:49.279 --> 0:14:51.139
was using a gessica tensho and Naruto

438
0:14:51.139 --> 0:14:53.749
just had a regular-sized Rasengan then

439
0:14:53.749 --> 0:14:56.240
yeah that would of course trump power

440
0:14:56.240 --> 0:14:58.249
again in sense of not just for the fact

441
0:14:58.249 --> 0:14:59.990
that naruto de can't throw a regular

442
0:14:59.990 --> 0:15:02.089
Rasengan and you know easily just you

443
0:15:02.089 --> 0:15:04.249
know that would rebound it but we also

444
0:15:04.249 --> 0:15:06.589
have russ and shuriken plus the giant

445
0:15:06.589 --> 0:15:08.179
orbital get fucked from 20 different

446
0:15:08.179 --> 0:15:09.980
directions and call me suzy orbital

447
0:15:09.980 --> 0:15:13.819
Rasengan barrage attack now that versus

448
0:15:13.819 --> 0:15:15.679
against a Content show you can't really

449
0:15:15.679 --> 0:15:19.069
say that this and this is so much

450
0:15:19.069 --> 0:15:21.170
differential in power like there's like

451
0:15:21.170 --> 0:15:23.119
oh yeah against those two things that'd

452
0:15:23.119 --> 0:15:25.309
be such a major difference too and you

453
0:15:25.309 --> 0:15:27.410
also can't really say like prep time for

454
0:15:27.410 --> 0:15:29.269
the attack to create ichigo can just

455
0:15:29.269 --> 0:15:31.249
swing his sword and use gets ago nor

456
0:15:31.249 --> 0:15:32.360
takes time to create

457
0:15:32.360 --> 0:15:34.009
yeah that used to be the case but

458
0:15:34.009 --> 0:15:35.660
remember a lot has changed ever since he

459
0:15:35.660 --> 0:15:37.579
accessed the ninetails fog Fox's chakra

460
0:15:37.579 --> 0:15:39.920
he could probably produce this many Ross

461
0:15:39.920 --> 0:15:41.779
Jenkins and I say probably because once

462
0:15:41.779 --> 0:15:43.730
again can conjecture but he could

463
0:15:43.730 --> 0:15:45.230
probably create this many Ross Jenkins

464
0:15:45.230 --> 0:15:47.179
and shadow clones with little issue now

465
0:15:47.179 --> 0:15:50.629
that he's has chrome on his side now um

466
0:15:50.629 --> 0:15:53.059
going up against any kind of ninja tool

467
0:15:53.059 --> 0:15:54.709
weapon that Naruto would use of course I

468
0:15:54.709 --> 0:15:55.999
know he doesn't use them that much

469
0:15:55.999 --> 0:15:57.110
anymore you never really use that much

470
0:15:57.110 --> 0:15:58.879
to begin with but let's just say he

471
0:15:58.879 --> 0:16:00.949
would use it in that situation Ichigo

472
0:16:00.949 --> 0:16:02.420
would pretty much be able to destroy

473
0:16:02.420 --> 0:16:04.100
anything that r2 pulls out even if it's

474
0:16:04.100 --> 0:16:06.769
the most highly crafted metal technique

475
0:16:06.769 --> 0:16:08.959
now Ichigo with zangetsu would be able

476
0:16:08.959 --> 0:16:10.489
to crack anything I mean that's probably

477
0:16:10.489 --> 0:16:12.049
never going to come up but I just had to

478
0:16:12.049 --> 0:16:13.040
mention it just for the sake of

479
0:16:13.040 --> 0:16:15.739
mentioning it also in terms of often

480
0:16:15.739 --> 0:16:17.179
civilities you gotta look at the shadow

481
0:16:17.179 --> 0:16:19.549
clones naruto is not very gifted at

482
0:16:19.549 --> 0:16:21.290
using the substitution technique and if

483
0:16:21.290 --> 0:16:22.549
you could use the substitution technique

484
0:16:22.549 --> 0:16:23.989
i'd probably just call this fight just

485
0:16:23.989 --> 0:16:25.759
now because ichigo doesn't have all

486
0:16:25.759 --> 0:16:27.170
these different tactics he's pretty much

487
0:16:27.170 --> 0:16:29.480
just a frontline fighter but Naruto is

488
0:16:29.480 --> 0:16:30.559
able to create clones

489
0:16:30.559 --> 0:16:32.509
he's been shown to be adept at switching

490
0:16:32.509 --> 0:16:34.009
out with clones or you know deceiving

491
0:16:34.009 --> 0:16:34.489
the enemy

492
0:16:34.489 --> 0:16:36.110
I'm not saying Ichigo is like a major

493
0:16:36.110 --> 0:16:38.689
idiot but in terms of battle strategy

494
0:16:38.689 --> 0:16:40.790
and extreme tactics he's not really the

495
0:16:40.790 --> 0:16:42.019
one you want to go to that would be

496
0:16:42.019 --> 0:16:43.519
something more suited for a cooky

497
0:16:43.519 --> 0:16:44.480
talking people that have been

498
0:16:44.480 --> 0:16:46.100
battle-hardened warriors for hundreds of

499
0:16:46.100 --> 0:16:48.110
years and know about battle tactics and

500
0:16:48.110 --> 0:16:50.209
everything and you know and abilities at

501
0:16:50.209 --> 0:16:52.009
the same time Naruto is not extremely

502
0:16:52.009 --> 0:16:53.899
gifted at battle strategies either but

503
0:16:53.899 --> 0:16:56.209
Naruto kind of went to school for this

504
0:16:56.209 --> 0:16:57.379
that's kind of what the Ninja Academy

505
0:16:57.379 --> 0:16:59.059
was for for learning about battle

506
0:16:59.059 --> 0:17:00.860
tactics attacking from the shadows and

507
0:17:00.860 --> 0:17:01.850
everything he wasn't the greatest

508
0:17:01.850 --> 0:17:03.679
student I'm just saying Ichigo had a

509
0:17:03.679 --> 0:17:06.319
regular education like me based around

510
0:17:06.319 --> 0:17:07.850
you know just like regular studies and

511
0:17:07.850 --> 0:17:09.438
everything Naruto's studies were based

512
0:17:09.438 --> 0:17:10.909
around learning other stuff and plus

513
0:17:10.909 --> 0:17:12.649
they live in a different world so even

514
0:17:12.649 --> 0:17:15.048
if Naruto didn't know about this stuff

515
0:17:15.048 --> 0:17:16.699
in school he would find him out about it

516
0:17:16.699 --> 0:17:18.558
just in the way they fight because the

517
0:17:18.558 --> 0:17:20.089
way characters fight in Naruto in the

518
0:17:20.089 --> 0:17:21.380
way they fight in Bleach are two

519
0:17:21.380 --> 0:17:22.490
completely different methods of

520
0:17:22.490 --> 0:17:24.649
attacking also that we've seen that

521
0:17:24.649 --> 0:17:26.870
Ichigo is not able to rapidly fire off

522
0:17:26.870 --> 0:17:28.669
get touka ten shows yes we've seen that

523
0:17:28.669 --> 0:17:30.080
he's able to you know fire it gets a go

524
0:17:30.080 --> 0:17:31.549
and then another gets ago what I'm

525
0:17:31.549 --> 0:17:33.320
saying is he's not able to do like you

526
0:17:33.320 --> 0:17:35.120
know get sick attend show barrage or

527
0:17:35.120 --> 0:17:36.470
something we've never seen like you know

528
0:17:36.470 --> 0:17:38.539
a Gatling gun version gets a gat n show

529
0:17:38.539 --> 0:17:41.690
okay so in a sense if Naruto use shadow

530
0:17:41.690 --> 0:17:43.370
clones and I was like fifty freaking

531
0:17:43.370 --> 0:17:44.630
Naruto's all with nine tails chakra

532
0:17:44.630 --> 0:17:45.740
running around in free

533
0:17:45.740 --> 0:17:47.090
SuperSpeed and we'll get to speed

534
0:17:47.090 --> 0:17:49.610
running around in super fast and Ichigo

535
0:17:49.610 --> 0:17:51.440
fires up against the contention getting

536
0:17:51.440 --> 0:17:53.240
disorienting not knowing which one is

537
0:17:53.240 --> 0:17:55.400
the real Naruto Naruto would have the

538
0:17:55.400 --> 0:17:56.480
advantage there because he would have

539
0:17:56.480 --> 0:17:57.860
multiple opportunities to chuck a

540
0:17:57.860 --> 0:17:59.750
freaking Ross and jerk in an Ichigo and

541
0:17:59.750 --> 0:18:02.780
we'll get into defensive later on but

542
0:18:02.780 --> 0:18:04.640
let me just say right now if each ego

543
0:18:04.640 --> 0:18:05.929
gets hit with one of those freaking

544
0:18:05.929 --> 0:18:07.610
things oscillating and God knows how

545
0:18:07.610 --> 0:18:09.050
many freaking frequencies that that

546
0:18:09.050 --> 0:18:12.140
pretty much tears yourselves apart then

547
0:18:12.140 --> 0:18:14.600
yeah I'm thinking that would sting a bit

548
0:18:14.600 --> 0:18:17.210
I'm just going to say in terms of attack

549
0:18:17.210 --> 0:18:19.460
and that could cause the most damage

550
0:18:19.460 --> 0:18:20.990
over the you know quickest amount of

551
0:18:20.990 --> 0:18:24.940
time I'm gonna give that one to Naruto

552
0:18:24.940 --> 0:18:27.679
next up we have defensive abilities and

553
0:18:27.679 --> 0:18:29.330
both in Naruto in each ego these are

554
0:18:29.330 --> 0:18:31.970
very slim but basically for Ichigo we

555
0:18:31.970 --> 0:18:34.160
have his reishi cushion we've seen that

556
0:18:34.160 --> 0:18:36.050
before Ichigo is pretty good at

557
0:18:36.050 --> 0:18:38.809
absorbing his reishi together is kind of

558
0:18:38.809 --> 0:18:40.429
like a cushion so then when you get a

559
0:18:40.429 --> 0:18:42.170
hit when he gets hit by an attack it

560
0:18:42.170 --> 0:18:43.670
reduces the damage it doesn't always

561
0:18:43.670 --> 0:18:45.200
reduce it completely but it takes less

562
0:18:45.200 --> 0:18:46.670
he takes less damage than you normally

563
0:18:46.670 --> 0:18:48.770
would have next up we also have holo

564
0:18:48.770 --> 0:18:50.270
mass when he goes to the hala mask he's

565
0:18:50.270 --> 0:18:51.650
able to take a lot more beating than he

566
0:18:51.650 --> 0:18:53.450
normally is this was seen when he was

567
0:18:53.450 --> 0:18:54.770
fighting against to cure each of you

568
0:18:54.770 --> 0:18:56.809
oaky aura under normal circumstances

569
0:18:56.809 --> 0:18:58.820
asaro was able to basically knock Ichigo

570
0:18:58.820 --> 0:19:00.740
out with his hollow mask ability after

571
0:19:00.740 --> 0:19:03.050
he you know regained it a little bit he

572
0:19:03.050 --> 0:19:04.429
was able to basically resist you if you

573
0:19:04.429 --> 0:19:06.679
are Sarah OH to get all together finally

574
0:19:06.679 --> 0:19:08.330
we have probably the one that a lot of

575
0:19:08.330 --> 0:19:09.710
people are mentioning the most that

576
0:19:09.710 --> 0:19:12.290
Ichigo would have is blue vein blue vein

577
0:19:12.290 --> 0:19:13.910
is the newest ability that Ichigo has

578
0:19:13.910 --> 0:19:15.170
gained and it's basically a defensive

579
0:19:15.170 --> 0:19:16.970
ability that was developed by the

580
0:19:16.970 --> 0:19:18.950
Quincy's essentially you harden the

581
0:19:18.950 --> 0:19:20.840
reishi inside of your blood vessels or

582
0:19:20.840 --> 0:19:22.640
you modify to a sense where it's able to

583
0:19:22.640 --> 0:19:25.220
basically resist attacks when juhabach

584
0:19:25.220 --> 0:19:27.590
was about to stab ichigo point-blank in

585
0:19:27.590 --> 0:19:29.660
the neck with a sword he was able to

586
0:19:29.660 --> 0:19:32.030
block it subconsciously using blue thing

587
0:19:32.030 --> 0:19:33.860
ichigo did not know he had the ability

588
0:19:33.860 --> 0:19:35.570
it was more just like a reflexes thing

589
0:19:35.570 --> 0:19:37.700
that he just gained after fighting after

590
0:19:37.700 --> 0:19:39.590
our getting released from quill Gees

591
0:19:39.590 --> 0:19:41.720
cage a lot of people are saying that

592
0:19:41.720 --> 0:19:44.300
with blue vein active and you know

593
0:19:44.300 --> 0:19:45.830
doesn't matter if in order to uses Ross

594
0:19:45.830 --> 0:19:47.480
and shuriken or whatever ichigo's able

595
0:19:47.480 --> 0:19:49.880
to resist that here's the problem I have

596
0:19:49.880 --> 0:19:52.580
with that number one ichigo just gained

597
0:19:52.580 --> 0:19:54.559
this ability therefore he didn't know he

598
0:19:54.559 --> 0:19:56.450
was using it it was purely reflexive and

599
0:19:56.450 --> 0:19:57.290
bland juhabach

600
0:19:57.290 --> 0:19:58.520
even said

601
0:19:58.520 --> 0:20:00.860
okay well I'll stab you again even

602
0:20:00.860 --> 0:20:03.140
harder and even blue vein won't be able

603
0:20:03.140 --> 0:20:05.990
to stop it so there is a clear limit to

604
0:20:05.990 --> 0:20:08.090
ichigo's blue vein it's not as polished

605
0:20:08.090 --> 0:20:10.520
as other bonded right members Chu of Ock

606
0:20:10.520 --> 0:20:12.590
you know he was fairly confident he was

607
0:20:12.590 --> 0:20:13.700
able to you know he would be able to

608
0:20:13.700 --> 0:20:16.310
break through it if he just knew if he

609
0:20:16.310 --> 0:20:18.140
you know put enough force the first time

610
0:20:18.140 --> 0:20:20.060
he attacked he didn't know he'd go had a

611
0:20:20.060 --> 0:20:22.130
blue vein and that's the thing Ichigo

612
0:20:22.130 --> 0:20:23.570
doesn't know about it he doesn't know

613
0:20:23.570 --> 0:20:25.070
anything about really Quincy abilities

614
0:20:25.070 --> 0:20:27.740
let alone blue vein he would not be able

615
0:20:27.740 --> 0:20:30.290
to activate this on command I mean it

616
0:20:30.290 --> 0:20:31.760
wouldn't be like in a fight when you

617
0:20:31.760 --> 0:20:33.200
know freakin Ross and sure Ken's headed

618
0:20:33.200 --> 0:20:34.880
toward Ichigo he would just be able to

619
0:20:34.880 --> 0:20:36.650
be like oh look they activate and then

620
0:20:36.650 --> 0:20:37.910
you know he'll be able to like you know

621
0:20:37.910 --> 0:20:40.010
resist it and like throw it away alright

622
0:20:40.010 --> 0:20:42.050
he's not able to activate it on a whim

623
0:20:42.050 --> 0:20:43.940
and also due to the fact that he's on

624
0:20:43.940 --> 0:20:46.130
not used to using it he would not have a

625
0:20:46.130 --> 0:20:47.930
very high limit with it yeah I was able

626
0:20:47.930 --> 0:20:51.200
to stop a sword okay well I let's just

627
0:20:51.200 --> 0:20:52.400
say he was able to let's just say it

628
0:20:52.400 --> 0:20:54.260
could stop a normal Rasengan but still

629
0:20:54.260 --> 0:20:56.390
I'm pretty sure Ichigo who's not used to

630
0:20:56.390 --> 0:20:57.920
using this kind of technique and clearly

631
0:20:57.920 --> 0:20:59.930
has its limits would be able to stop

632
0:20:59.930 --> 0:21:01.580
something like a Ross and shuriken or

633
0:21:01.580 --> 0:21:03.590
like a planetary Rasengan just using

634
0:21:03.590 --> 0:21:05.660
blue vein which would be something that

635
0:21:05.660 --> 0:21:07.520
we maybe have to use reflexively at that

636
0:21:07.520 --> 0:21:09.770
point it might be able to lessen the

637
0:21:09.770 --> 0:21:11.930
damage of it but it would certainly not

638
0:21:11.930 --> 0:21:15.500
be able to stop it altogether and also

639
0:21:15.500 --> 0:21:17.090
Naruto would be able to use this in

640
0:21:17.090 --> 0:21:18.530
multiple succession because we've seen

641
0:21:18.530 --> 0:21:20.690
he's been able to do that alright so

642
0:21:20.690 --> 0:21:23.030
defensive techniques in terms of Naruto

643
0:21:23.030 --> 0:21:24.740
he's able to use sage mode which

644
0:21:24.740 --> 0:21:26.810
increases basically all his base stats

645
0:21:26.810 --> 0:21:28.580
right away he's been able to take damage

646
0:21:28.580 --> 0:21:30.740
like that he's able to lift up a giant

647
0:21:30.740 --> 0:21:32.240
freaking stone frog so I would imagine

648
0:21:32.240 --> 0:21:33.740
that his defensive capabilities have

649
0:21:33.740 --> 0:21:35.720
increased somewhat he fell off for

650
0:21:35.720 --> 0:21:37.460
exampie fell off that giant cliff and he

651
0:21:37.460 --> 0:21:38.870
landed on the ground he flew like what

652
0:21:38.870 --> 0:21:39.950
was that like ten stories in the

653
0:21:39.950 --> 0:21:41.330
freaking air he fell and hit the ground

654
0:21:41.330 --> 0:21:43.370
and he wasn't even barely rattled so

655
0:21:43.370 --> 0:21:45.200
defensive clear abilities clearly

656
0:21:45.200 --> 0:21:47.390
increased at that point also he's kind

657
0:21:47.390 --> 0:21:48.710
of a master of Sage Mode he was able to

658
0:21:48.710 --> 0:21:50.450
master it even beyond Jiraiya so it

659
0:21:50.450 --> 0:21:51.860
would be fair to call him a sage mode

660
0:21:51.860 --> 0:21:54.320
master also we have the ninetails cloak

661
0:21:54.320 --> 0:21:55.490
and those are really the only two

662
0:21:55.490 --> 0:21:57.410
defensive skills that Naruto has but the

663
0:21:57.410 --> 0:21:58.700
ninetails cloak what I'm talking about

664
0:21:58.700 --> 0:22:00.560
here is I'm not referring to the three

665
0:22:00.560 --> 0:22:02.810
four tails you know blood red Naruto

666
0:22:02.810 --> 0:22:05.270
crazy Berserker mode okay those are not

667
0:22:05.270 --> 0:22:06.650
going to be included because you can't

668
0:22:06.650 --> 0:22:07.970
have both you can't have the crazy

669
0:22:07.970 --> 0:22:09.950
Berserker mode and the controlled form

670
0:22:09.950 --> 0:22:11.990
trauma and naruto are on good terms

671
0:22:11.990 --> 0:22:13.820
right now so let's just say that those

672
0:22:13.820 --> 0:22:15.260
techniques that Nora was able to do like

673
0:22:15.260 --> 0:22:16.790
the six tails and everything let's just

674
0:22:16.790 --> 0:22:18.620
say those are not in the equation

675
0:22:18.620 --> 0:22:18.980
anymore

676
0:22:18.980 --> 0:22:21.050
the nine tails cloak he's got the kind

677
0:22:21.050 --> 0:22:22.910
of the full control form and he also has

678
0:22:22.910 --> 0:22:25.309
that version to form and he also has the

679
0:22:25.309 --> 0:22:27.230
ability to turn into the Fox itself now

680
0:22:27.230 --> 0:22:28.700
the only reason I didn't mention the

681
0:22:28.700 --> 0:22:30.980
whole transformation thing is I consider

682
0:22:30.980 --> 0:22:33.020
that more of an augmentation and then a

683
0:22:33.020 --> 0:22:36.890
full-on attack ability because we will

684
0:22:36.890 --> 0:22:38.600
see more than that but once he activates

685
0:22:38.600 --> 0:22:40.280
the ninetails Fox you know we'll get

686
0:22:40.280 --> 0:22:42.830
down to augmentation so the sage voted

687
0:22:42.830 --> 0:22:44.540
nine tails cloak unlike ichigo's blue

688
0:22:44.540 --> 0:22:46.580
vein he's mastered both of those he

689
0:22:46.580 --> 0:22:47.990
can't go into both of them at the same

690
0:22:47.990 --> 0:22:49.309
time I want to be clear on that he can't

691
0:22:49.309 --> 0:22:51.200
go sage mode and full nine tails chakra

692
0:22:51.200 --> 0:22:55.100
but if he does go into nine tails cloak

693
0:22:55.100 --> 0:22:56.660
and nine Ichigo we're hitting it with

694
0:22:56.660 --> 0:22:58.640
the gessica tensho not saying we'd be

695
0:22:58.640 --> 0:23:00.590
able to stop the attack altogether but

696
0:23:00.590 --> 0:23:02.330
he would take significant less damage

697
0:23:02.330 --> 0:23:03.920
than if you were just in normal form you

698
0:23:03.920 --> 0:23:05.300
have to give me that much fandom you

699
0:23:05.300 --> 0:23:07.910
have to give me that much okay and aside

700
0:23:07.910 --> 0:23:09.440
from that fact we also have to look at

701
0:23:09.440 --> 0:23:11.780
the fact that Naruto has augmented

702
0:23:11.780 --> 0:23:13.070
healing through the nine tails chakra

703
0:23:13.070 --> 0:23:15.020
which is basically a second reserve of

704
0:23:15.020 --> 0:23:17.090
chakra that's essentially infinite it

705
0:23:17.090 --> 0:23:18.710
not it isn't infinite but it's

706
0:23:18.710 --> 0:23:20.059
essentially a like we've never really

707
0:23:20.059 --> 0:23:22.700
seen the nine tails uh you know really

708
0:23:22.700 --> 0:23:24.890
run out of chakra until recent chapter

709
0:23:24.890 --> 0:23:26.090
is when he's been portioning it out

710
0:23:26.090 --> 0:23:27.230
through everybody and that would clearly

711
0:23:27.230 --> 0:23:29.330
not be the case with this but he has

712
0:23:29.330 --> 0:23:30.890
healing ability so you go to speed up

713
0:23:30.890 --> 0:23:33.050
healing so Ichigo doesn't have that same

714
0:23:33.050 --> 0:23:35.450
healing ability so right there you know

715
0:23:35.450 --> 0:23:37.730
Naruto full ninetails chakra control

716
0:23:37.730 --> 0:23:39.920
form cloak ichigo hits him with gets ago

717
0:23:39.920 --> 0:23:42.679
even in bankai you know Naruto would be

718
0:23:42.679 --> 0:23:44.179
injured a little bit but through his

719
0:23:44.179 --> 0:23:45.530
healing abilities and through he can

720
0:23:45.530 --> 0:23:46.940
just you know send out a couple shadow

721
0:23:46.940 --> 0:23:48.679
clones as diversionary tactics while he

722
0:23:48.679 --> 0:23:51.860
heals up I don't see much of a problem

723
0:23:51.860 --> 0:23:52.250
here

724
0:23:52.250 --> 0:23:54.470
so let's just ignore blue vein for the

725
0:23:54.470 --> 0:23:55.670
moment let's just cut that out of the

726
0:23:55.670 --> 0:23:57.890
equation through using ichigo's hollow

727
0:23:57.890 --> 0:24:00.110
mask abilities and spiritual pressure

728
0:24:00.110 --> 0:24:02.150
cushioning along with naruto's

729
0:24:02.150 --> 0:24:05.510
nine-tails cushion that would be about

730
0:24:05.510 --> 0:24:08.270
equal the only thing that's tipping the

731
0:24:08.270 --> 0:24:10.790
scale here is Naruto's healing ability

732
0:24:10.790 --> 0:24:12.320
that's the only thing that's tipping the

733
0:24:12.320 --> 0:24:14.720
scale if it was just between nine tails

734
0:24:14.720 --> 0:24:16.670
cloak versus Halla mask plus ichigo's

735
0:24:16.670 --> 0:24:18.500
reishi cushion defense I could say

736
0:24:18.500 --> 0:24:20.390
that's an even that's an even

737
0:24:20.390 --> 0:24:22.669
justification there but Naruto can heal

738
0:24:22.669 --> 0:24:25.220
Ichigo you can't

739
0:24:25.220 --> 0:24:27.020
and now support characters are not

740
0:24:27.020 --> 0:24:31.070
allowed next up is speed now which of

741
0:24:31.070 --> 0:24:33.640
these characters has the great Ichigo

742
0:24:33.640 --> 0:24:36.560
alright so yeah that one pretty much

743
0:24:36.560 --> 0:24:38.210
right away I don't even have to really

744
0:24:38.210 --> 0:24:39.470
give because there's not really a lot of

745
0:24:39.470 --> 0:24:41.510
stuff to go off of here in terms of

746
0:24:41.510 --> 0:24:43.400
speed Ichigo has his bankai ability

747
0:24:43.400 --> 0:24:44.810
along with he has whole mass which

748
0:24:44.810 --> 0:24:47.540
increases his speed further Naruto we've

749
0:24:47.540 --> 0:24:50.090
seen he could you know run faster we

750
0:24:50.090 --> 0:24:51.500
hasn't really mastered the bloody flip

751
0:24:51.500 --> 0:24:52.820
the body flicker the teleportation

752
0:24:52.820 --> 0:24:54.380
techniques so that doesn't really count

753
0:24:54.380 --> 0:24:57.500
there you could say so I didn't write

754
0:24:57.500 --> 0:24:59.450
down sage mode but you could say sage

755
0:24:59.450 --> 0:25:01.190
mode he could run faster but I didn't

756
0:25:01.190 --> 0:25:02.510
even include that because it would be so

757
0:25:02.510 --> 0:25:04.850
miniscule in terms of just super powers

758
0:25:04.850 --> 0:25:06.860
and the thing that I really wrote down

759
0:25:06.860 --> 0:25:08.180
the only thing I wrote down in terms of

760
0:25:08.180 --> 0:25:10.640
Naruto for speed would be the imperfect

761
0:25:10.640 --> 0:25:12.500
yellow flash technique because we saw

762
0:25:12.500 --> 0:25:14.000
after he activated the full nine tails

763
0:25:14.000 --> 0:25:16.130
cloak he was able to like jump across a

764
0:25:16.130 --> 0:25:17.690
freaking room and Killer Bee made that

765
0:25:17.690 --> 0:25:19.970
comment oh I saw was a yellow flash yo

766
0:25:19.970 --> 0:25:23.000
and that gave it credence to believe

767
0:25:23.000 --> 0:25:24.920
that Naruto would basically you know

768
0:25:24.920 --> 0:25:26.540
Matt like have the same ability as his

769
0:25:26.540 --> 0:25:27.470
dad who'd be able to use the yellow

770
0:25:27.470 --> 0:25:29.600
flash technique the same problem with

771
0:25:29.600 --> 0:25:31.340
that is the same problem I had with blue

772
0:25:31.340 --> 0:25:33.680
Fane it's imperfect even in the same

773
0:25:33.680 --> 0:25:35.540
chapter I think Yamamoto even said

774
0:25:35.540 --> 0:25:37.220
that's not you have to be careful how

775
0:25:37.220 --> 0:25:38.900
you do how you use your new powers so

776
0:25:38.900 --> 0:25:41.330
we've seen probably since then in or

777
0:25:41.330 --> 0:25:43.520
just been able to master it a little bit

778
0:25:43.520 --> 0:25:45.550
but we haven't seen him use it a very uh

779
0:25:45.550 --> 0:25:47.750
we haven't seen him use it a lot and

780
0:25:47.750 --> 0:25:48.890
there's probably a reason for that

781
0:25:48.890 --> 0:25:50.660
because Naruto is not gifted at using

782
0:25:50.660 --> 0:25:53.390
the nine tails you know speed now would

783
0:25:53.390 --> 0:25:55.520
the yellow flash technique along with

784
0:25:55.520 --> 0:25:57.020
bankai whole amounts would that be equal

785
0:25:57.020 --> 0:25:59.870
sure if Naruto had it mastered if Naruto

786
0:25:59.870 --> 0:26:01.970
had it mastered the point that Minato

787
0:26:01.970 --> 0:26:03.980
had it then I would say speed would be

788
0:26:03.980 --> 0:26:05.510
about the same but it's not so that's

789
0:26:05.510 --> 0:26:08.840
why I gave speed to Ichigo next up is

790
0:26:08.840 --> 0:26:10.550
augmentation abilities abilities that

791
0:26:10.550 --> 0:26:11.900
they use to increase their own power I

792
0:26:11.900 --> 0:26:13.130
might have mentioned a little bit of

793
0:26:13.130 --> 0:26:14.510
these before because they go hand in

794
0:26:14.510 --> 0:26:16.340
hand for example with Ichigo

795
0:26:16.340 --> 0:26:18.260
we have bankai and we have hollow masks

796
0:26:18.260 --> 0:26:21.020
those are two abilities that he has that

797
0:26:21.020 --> 0:26:22.640
are augments but they also have a that

798
0:26:22.640 --> 0:26:24.110
he also pretty much jumps to bankai

799
0:26:24.110 --> 0:26:26.570
right away and whole masks if things get

800
0:26:26.570 --> 0:26:28.730
really dicey other abilities you might

801
0:26:28.730 --> 0:26:29.810
think why I'm not mentioning are

802
0:26:29.810 --> 0:26:31.430
ichigo's fullbring which of course was

803
0:26:31.430 --> 0:26:33.410
fused with his shikai which is why his

804
0:26:33.410 --> 0:26:35.180
shikai is much considerably more

805
0:26:35.180 --> 0:26:36.680
stronger than at what it used to be and

806
0:26:36.680 --> 0:26:38.690
 hollow mass which of course we met

807
0:26:38.690 --> 0:26:39.980
like he hasn't used it yet but let's

808
0:26:39.980 --> 0:26:41.360
just say it was on the same level when

809
0:26:41.360 --> 0:26:43.220
he fought against Aizen with the the two

810
0:26:43.220 --> 0:26:45.170
stripes ring down the side which would

811
0:26:45.170 --> 0:26:46.430
increase his spiritual pressure and

812
0:26:46.430 --> 0:26:48.200
everything drastically there I didn't

813
0:26:48.200 --> 0:26:49.490
put final get the content show for

814
0:26:49.490 --> 0:26:51.380
reasons I previously mentioned so those

815
0:26:51.380 --> 0:26:53.420
are in terms of his arguments so in

816
0:26:53.420 --> 0:26:55.280
terms of Naruto four augments I mean

817
0:26:55.280 --> 0:26:57.230
sage mode is one but I already kind of

818
0:26:57.230 --> 0:26:58.820
you know flush that out anyway and oh by

819
0:26:58.820 --> 0:27:02.810
the way sage mode is crap no sage mode

820
0:27:02.810 --> 0:27:05.210
is not crap just taking away all the

821
0:27:05.210 --> 0:27:06.680
offensive abilities that sage mode gives

822
0:27:06.680 --> 0:27:08.840
Naruto the sensing ability and the

823
0:27:08.840 --> 0:27:10.190
ability to you know select natural

824
0:27:10.190 --> 0:27:11.810
natural energy and everything which by

825
0:27:11.810 --> 0:27:13.340
the way in this neutral universe Naruto

826
0:27:13.340 --> 0:27:16.310
would have at the same time it's sensing

827
0:27:16.310 --> 0:27:17.720
abilities and be able to focus on

828
0:27:17.720 --> 0:27:19.520
everything that would be a greater asset

829
0:27:19.520 --> 0:27:21.440
than just sheer power but whenever I

830
0:27:21.440 --> 0:27:23.030
pretty much flushed out sage mode the

831
0:27:23.030 --> 0:27:24.680
augment is the nine tails chakra forms

832
0:27:24.680 --> 0:27:26.330
he has the to cloak forms he can go into

833
0:27:26.330 --> 0:27:28.520
and he's the ability to turn into the

834
0:27:28.520 --> 0:27:32.090
actual Fox right now the major augment

835
0:27:32.090 --> 0:27:33.920
behind this though is not just the fact

836
0:27:33.920 --> 0:27:35.480
he's able to turn into the Fox it's

837
0:27:35.480 --> 0:27:38.450
communication with Kurama and that's

838
0:27:38.450 --> 0:27:39.890
probably one of the greatest augments

839
0:27:39.890 --> 0:27:41.630
that he has is Naruto he's not alone

840
0:27:41.630 --> 0:27:43.970
when he's fighting he has Kurama there

841
0:27:43.970 --> 0:27:46.340
now to help him out sure but if we're

842
0:27:46.340 --> 0:27:48.410
talking if we're talking before he

843
0:27:48.410 --> 0:27:50.180
matched the nine tails this would be a

844
0:27:50.180 --> 0:27:51.770
completely different fight I wouldn't

845
0:27:51.770 --> 0:27:53.000
have included half the Rasengan

846
0:27:53.000 --> 0:27:54.170
abilities because he wouldn't have had

847
0:27:54.170 --> 0:27:55.970
them without the nine tails I wouldn't

848
0:27:55.970 --> 0:27:57.290
have included the freakin nine tails

849
0:27:57.290 --> 0:27:58.520
forms because he would go back to just

850
0:27:58.520 --> 0:28:00.380
being a berserker but the fact of the

851
0:28:00.380 --> 0:28:02.420
matter is now that he's gotten on good

852
0:28:02.420 --> 0:28:04.250
terms with Kurama they're able to

853
0:28:04.250 --> 0:28:05.480
communicate back and forth they have

854
0:28:05.480 --> 0:28:07.190
this telepathy they're able to think of

855
0:28:07.190 --> 0:28:09.050
better battle strategies Kurama is able

856
0:28:09.050 --> 0:28:11.360
to basically tell him and you know when

857
0:28:11.360 --> 0:28:13.130
he's being stupid or like no don't do

858
0:28:13.130 --> 0:28:14.720
that it will get killed and he's also

859
0:28:14.720 --> 0:28:16.370
able to gather chakra while Naruto is

860
0:28:16.370 --> 0:28:19.070
off doing something else so yeah it's

861
0:28:19.070 --> 0:28:21.640
better communication sure Ichigo has

862
0:28:21.640 --> 0:28:24.020
zangetsu with him but song ketsu a

863
0:28:24.020 --> 0:28:26.030
relationship with Ichigo is not the same

864
0:28:26.030 --> 0:28:27.650
as with Kurama with Naruto

865
0:28:27.650 --> 0:28:29.510
when ichigo's fighting and he's getting

866
0:28:29.510 --> 0:28:31.310
his ass kicked you know we don't see

867
0:28:31.310 --> 0:28:33.410
zangetsu pop in and be like hey ichigo

868
0:28:33.410 --> 0:28:35.360
yeah you're about to die so here take

869
0:28:35.360 --> 0:28:37.580
some of my reiatsu because his reactive

870
0:28:37.580 --> 0:28:39.080
is kind of the same as ichigo so we

871
0:28:39.080 --> 0:28:40.400
don't we don't ever see that happening

872
0:28:40.400 --> 0:28:41.300
with zangetsu

873
0:28:41.300 --> 0:28:43.130
there's hollow Ichigo with stepped in a

874
0:28:43.130 --> 0:28:45.350
few times but he's only there just show

875
0:28:45.350 --> 0:28:47.270
up if ichigo's about to get killed

876
0:28:47.270 --> 0:28:49.130
that's the only way that Halloween

877
0:28:49.130 --> 0:28:50.390
should go ever shows up and we're going

878
0:28:50.390 --> 0:28:50.780
off

879
0:28:50.780 --> 0:28:52.370
you know old hollow Ichigo back when you

880
0:28:52.370 --> 0:28:54.260
is really cool um you know he's not

881
0:28:54.260 --> 0:28:56.030
there to give him advice in any way

882
0:28:56.030 --> 0:28:57.470
shape or form he only shows up if

883
0:28:57.470 --> 0:28:59.840
ichigo's about to die he either takes

884
0:28:59.840 --> 0:29:01.730
control of ichigo's body very briefly

885
0:29:01.730 --> 0:29:04.460
and then goes away or he becomes full

886
0:29:04.460 --> 0:29:06.650
hollow Ichigo for a little bit before he

887
0:29:06.650 --> 0:29:09.410
goes away or he gets damaged to a degree

888
0:29:09.410 --> 0:29:11.210
where he has to revert back so that's

889
0:29:11.210 --> 0:29:13.370
the only way that he would show back up

890
0:29:13.370 --> 0:29:16.820
so let's just say off the off the cuff

891
0:29:16.820 --> 0:29:19.370
here you know Naruto kicks the shit out

892
0:29:19.370 --> 0:29:21.950
of each ego and Ichigo you know on the

893
0:29:21.950 --> 0:29:24.110
brink of death whole Ichigo takes over

894
0:29:24.110 --> 0:29:26.210
he goes into full uber Jedi mode that he

895
0:29:26.210 --> 0:29:28.610
used against Duke Yura in this form he

896
0:29:28.610 --> 0:29:30.650
can use gessica tensho eyes away can he

897
0:29:30.650 --> 0:29:32.000
still used yeah I probably can use guess

898
0:29:32.000 --> 0:29:34.309
he didn't show he has cero now and he's

899
0:29:34.309 --> 0:29:36.110
basically a berserker versus uh you know

900
0:29:36.110 --> 0:29:38.720
tail beasts version Naruto I would still

901
0:29:38.720 --> 0:29:41.600
say in that situation Naruto would still

902
0:29:41.600 --> 0:29:43.429
win he would probably have to go full

903
0:29:43.429 --> 0:29:44.960
tailed form beast mode

904
0:29:44.960 --> 0:29:46.820
he would stuff to go full tail beast

905
0:29:46.820 --> 0:29:48.679
mode probably take this thing on but

906
0:29:48.679 --> 0:29:50.570
we've seen that even this form has

907
0:29:50.570 --> 0:29:53.210
limits you know when Ichigo when you cut

908
0:29:53.210 --> 0:29:54.679
off his horn and you know freakin cero

909
0:29:54.679 --> 0:29:56.420
blows up in his face he had to resort

910
0:29:56.420 --> 0:29:58.820
back to his regular form so even though

911
0:29:58.820 --> 0:30:00.320
he's a beserker and he has an insane

912
0:30:00.320 --> 0:30:01.970
amount of react to an insane amount of

913
0:30:01.970 --> 0:30:03.950
power SuperSpeed and everything with

914
0:30:03.950 --> 0:30:04.460
sonido

915
0:30:04.460 --> 0:30:06.650
there's still a limit he could still get

916
0:30:06.650 --> 0:30:09.110
broken you know tail beasts freakin

917
0:30:09.110 --> 0:30:11.300
Bijou dominoes freakin shoot Ichigo and

918
0:30:11.300 --> 0:30:13.130
that has to be worth at least a cero

919
0:30:13.130 --> 0:30:15.050
you have to say at least the tailed

920
0:30:15.050 --> 0:30:18.110
beast Buju dama which look what this

921
0:30:18.110 --> 0:30:32.230
shit can do

922
0:30:32.230 --> 0:30:35.330
yeah I think that would maybe at least

923
0:30:35.330 --> 0:30:37.340
equal the amount of cero ability a

924
0:30:37.340 --> 0:30:39.980
little bit so just in terms of that in

925
0:30:39.980 --> 0:30:42.110
terms of the help that Kurama would give

926
0:30:42.110 --> 0:30:44.000
Naruto in terms of you know augmented

927
0:30:44.000 --> 0:30:46.730
powers I got to go with Naruto on this

928
0:30:46.730 --> 0:30:50.870
one I know you guys are going to hate me

929
0:30:50.870 --> 0:30:53.270
because out of the five groups I came up

930
0:30:53.270 --> 0:30:56.270
with I essentially gave Naruto three out

931
0:30:56.270 --> 0:30:59.810
of the four so far so a flash group last

932
0:30:59.810 --> 0:31:01.700
group we have miscellaneous abilities

933
0:31:01.700 --> 0:31:03.770
abilities that I didn't really other

934
0:31:03.770 --> 0:31:05.450
things I didn't only get to mention in

935
0:31:05.450 --> 0:31:07.580
other parts of the video for Ichigo I

936
0:31:07.580 --> 0:31:09.590
just have the ability of flights which

937
0:31:09.590 --> 0:31:11.450
somebody mentioned the ability to fly or

938
0:31:11.450 --> 0:31:13.340
if you don't want to say flight ability

939
0:31:13.340 --> 0:31:14.990
to maintain you know he can maintain his

940
0:31:14.990 --> 0:31:16.700
stance in the air we've seen Ichigo can

941
0:31:16.700 --> 0:31:18.200
stay in the air indefinitely let's just

942
0:31:18.200 --> 0:31:19.910
refer to lay this flight for now other

943
0:31:19.910 --> 0:31:22.880
things the Naruto has are basically just

944
0:31:22.880 --> 0:31:24.440
ninja tactics which I kind of already

945
0:31:24.440 --> 0:31:26.000
mentioned ninja tactics he's able to you

946
0:31:26.000 --> 0:31:27.440
know he's better at deception he's

947
0:31:27.440 --> 0:31:28.610
better at that stuff kind of stuff and

948
0:31:28.610 --> 0:31:30.380
Ichigo is and that's not fighting dirty

949
0:31:30.380 --> 0:31:32.030
that's just fighting how a ninja fights

950
0:31:32.030 --> 0:31:33.710
that's like two completely different you

951
0:31:33.710 --> 0:31:35.180
know ways how you fight so once again

952
0:31:35.180 --> 0:31:37.100
compensation some people said that

953
0:31:37.100 --> 0:31:39.200
because Naruto I mean Ichigo was able to

954
0:31:39.200 --> 0:31:42.770
fly an r2 can't there for Ichigo would

955
0:31:42.770 --> 0:31:45.770
have the main advantage okay well let's

956
0:31:45.770 --> 0:31:47.090
look at it like this and I made this

957
0:31:47.090 --> 0:31:48.530
comparison on my livestream but let's

958
0:31:48.530 --> 0:31:50.930
just look at it like this okay so let's

959
0:31:50.930 --> 0:31:54.650
have like a tank versus a plane and you

960
0:31:54.650 --> 0:31:56.540
immediately saying oh the plane wins

961
0:31:56.540 --> 0:31:58.940
because the plane can fly it's faster

962
0:31:58.940 --> 0:32:00.530
has better maneuverability than just a

963
0:32:00.530 --> 0:32:02.800
slow sluggish tank which is grounded

964
0:32:02.800 --> 0:32:05.540
that's not really that true I mean sure

965
0:32:05.540 --> 0:32:06.950
the plane could you know move a lot

966
0:32:06.950 --> 0:32:10.010
faster but at the same time one hit from

967
0:32:10.010 --> 0:32:13.580
the tank it might be hard but if it

968
0:32:13.580 --> 0:32:15.590
happens and I'm certainly happened

969
0:32:15.590 --> 0:32:16.910
before and you know conflicts and

970
0:32:16.910 --> 0:32:18.530
everything it can go down kind of the

971
0:32:18.530 --> 0:32:20.900
same thing with Ichigo Ichigo combined

972
0:32:20.900 --> 0:32:22.730
with speed and his flight can maintain

973
0:32:22.730 --> 0:32:24.740
an altitude you know for an indefinite

974
0:32:24.740 --> 0:32:25.520
period of time

975
0:32:25.520 --> 0:32:28.400
Noora on the other hand sage mode nine

976
0:32:28.400 --> 0:32:30.290
tails chakra he can propel himself into

977
0:32:30.290 --> 0:32:31.820
the air but he cannot maintain an

978
0:32:31.820 --> 0:32:34.070
altitude he can't we've seen him in his

979
0:32:34.070 --> 0:32:35.690
fight against Mew for example the other

980
0:32:35.690 --> 0:32:37.550
second su Chi cago Mew had the

981
0:32:37.550 --> 0:32:39.680
levitation jutsu he could stay in the

982
0:32:39.680 --> 0:32:41.000
air for indefinite period of time or

983
0:32:41.000 --> 0:32:41.960
until he ran out of chalk

984
0:32:41.960 --> 0:32:45.260
so how Naruto Calif on him was launched

985
0:32:45.260 --> 0:32:46.460
himself in the everything ninetails

986
0:32:46.460 --> 0:32:49.370
chakra he used a planetary Rasengan to

987
0:32:49.370 --> 0:32:51.830
attack MU along with his chakra arms

988
0:32:51.830 --> 0:32:53.540
which were able to extend his reach

989
0:32:53.540 --> 0:32:55.490
indefinitely and that's how he took down

990
0:32:55.490 --> 0:32:58.670
mu so in this situation I'm going to say

991
0:32:58.670 --> 0:33:00.560
you might be saying like Oh ichigo's you

992
0:33:00.560 --> 0:33:02.060
know he has flight and he's super fast

993
0:33:02.060 --> 0:33:03.740
with his bankai and you said he

994
0:33:03.740 --> 0:33:05.540
Ichigo would win in terms of speed so

995
0:33:05.540 --> 0:33:07.580
there's no way Ichigo like Naruto would

996
0:33:07.580 --> 0:33:08.780
be able to hit him when he's up in the

997
0:33:08.780 --> 0:33:10.760
air you know like like I'm he's was it

998
0:33:10.760 --> 0:33:12.410
around like that there's no way Ichigo

999
0:33:12.410 --> 0:33:13.850
Naruto would be able to hit him with

1000
0:33:13.850 --> 0:33:16.130
rust and shuriken or anything um once

1001
0:33:16.130 --> 0:33:18.230
again I got to say sage mode which

1002
0:33:18.230 --> 0:33:20.180
better senses things nine tails chakra

1003
0:33:20.180 --> 0:33:22.070
which basically it has a mind of its own

1004
0:33:22.070 --> 0:33:23.870
essentially I mean look perfect example

1005
0:33:23.870 --> 0:33:26.480
look at Sasuke after Sasuke mastered the

1006
0:33:26.480 --> 0:33:28.490
Sharingan essentially he was able to

1007
0:33:28.490 --> 0:33:30.470
dodge Naruto's moves no problem with his

1008
0:33:30.470 --> 0:33:31.730
speed and just because he was able to

1009
0:33:31.730 --> 0:33:33.920
see Naruto's movements but because the

1010
0:33:33.920 --> 0:33:35.510
nine tails chakra had a mind of its own

1011
0:33:35.510 --> 0:33:37.940
you pretty much have two things coming

1012
0:33:37.940 --> 0:33:39.380
at you at the same time and going back

1013
0:33:39.380 --> 0:33:41.360
to shadow clones conceivably more than

1014
0:33:41.360 --> 0:33:43.790
two so take whatever number of shadow

1015
0:33:43.790 --> 0:33:45.590
clones Naruto has and double that

1016
0:33:45.590 --> 0:33:47.660
because the nine tails chakra and you

1017
0:33:47.660 --> 0:33:49.660
got attacks coming from every direction

1018
0:33:49.660 --> 0:33:52.130
the speed is only really good if you're

1019
0:33:52.130 --> 0:33:55.070
facing a one opponent or a lower number

1020
0:33:55.070 --> 0:33:56.750
of opponents that can't hit you but you

1021
0:33:56.750 --> 0:33:57.950
know let's say you have a plane in the

1022
0:33:57.950 --> 0:34:00.320
air one plane one tank the tanks

1023
0:34:00.320 --> 0:34:01.580
probably have a hard time hitting the

1024
0:34:01.580 --> 0:34:04.700
plane you have a freaking hundred tanks

1025
0:34:04.700 --> 0:34:06.230
on the ground all launching up at the

1026
0:34:06.230 --> 0:34:09.169
same time that might cause an issue if

1027
0:34:09.169 --> 0:34:11.120
you don't believe me there then you know

1028
0:34:11.120 --> 0:34:13.370
Naruto would go full freakin nine tails

1029
0:34:13.370 --> 0:34:16.490
chakra form into freakin the Fox you

1030
0:34:16.490 --> 0:34:18.980
know ten story Fox there versus Ichigo I

1031
0:34:18.980 --> 0:34:20.389
think your flight abilities kind of been

1032
0:34:20.389 --> 0:34:22.580
you know nullify your flight advantage

1033
0:34:22.580 --> 0:34:25.158
been nullified there but at the same

1034
0:34:25.158 --> 0:34:27.230
time that's going off with a lot of ifs

1035
0:34:27.230 --> 0:34:28.850
there so just for the sake of you know

1036
0:34:28.850 --> 0:34:30.648
ifs and everything I'm going to go with

1037
0:34:30.648 --> 0:34:32.179
in terms of other or miscellaneous

1038
0:34:32.179 --> 0:34:34.460
abilities I'm going to say they're both

1039
0:34:34.460 --> 0:34:35.830
equal

1040
0:34:35.830 --> 0:34:37.929
so final round up in terms of attack

1041
0:34:37.929 --> 0:34:40.659
give that to Norco and in terms of speed

1042
0:34:40.659 --> 0:34:43.270
Ichigo in terms of augments Naruto and

1043
0:34:43.270 --> 0:34:45.909
in terms of flight or other I was going

1044
0:34:45.909 --> 0:34:48.550
to say Naruto on this but just to be you

1045
0:34:48.550 --> 0:34:50.290
know just to be even I'll give even

1046
0:34:50.290 --> 0:34:52.780
there so with with this ability we'd do

1047
0:34:52.780 --> 0:34:54.310
with this uh you know group and

1048
0:34:54.310 --> 0:34:56.770
everything I've set up I have to say

1049
0:34:56.770 --> 0:34:59.020
I've said it before I'll say it again

1050
0:34:59.020 --> 0:35:01.020
I'm gonna get scrutiny for saying it

1051
0:35:01.020 --> 0:35:03.520
Naruto would win in a fight between them

1052
0:35:03.520 --> 0:35:06.430
so that's my first episode of checking

1053
0:35:06.430 --> 0:35:07.630
showdowns by the way i don't know if i'm

1054
0:35:07.630 --> 0:35:09.310
i keep calling it that hope you guys

1055
0:35:09.310 --> 0:35:12.130
enjoy it I'll I'm dreading the comments

1056
0:35:12.130 --> 0:35:13.350
on this this is probably going to be

1057
0:35:13.350 --> 0:35:15.700
this is going to be freaking - this

1058
0:35:15.700 --> 0:35:18.070
gonna be a POC - left apocalyptic but at

1059
0:35:18.070 --> 0:35:20.620
the same time this is just me I told you

1060
0:35:20.620 --> 0:35:22.330
this is the way I choose to set off the

1061
0:35:22.330 --> 0:35:23.950
fight if this is not what you agree with

1062
0:35:23.950 --> 0:35:26.080
fine more power to you and you'll

1063
0:35:26.080 --> 0:35:27.460
probably make your opinion very well

1064
0:35:27.460 --> 0:35:28.480
known in the comments below

1065
0:35:28.480 --> 0:35:30.580
go watch somebody else who you do agree

1066
0:35:30.580 --> 0:35:32.050
with there's many people on YouTube that

1067
0:35:32.050 --> 0:35:33.580
do this kind of crossover fighting thing

1068
0:35:33.580 --> 0:35:35.890
and this is how I chose to do mine so

1069
0:35:35.890 --> 0:35:38.800
you know there you go and just they just

1070
0:35:38.800 --> 0:35:40.600
before before I sign off here let me

1071
0:35:40.600 --> 0:35:42.820
just say one thing and I know yeah I I

1072
0:35:42.820 --> 0:35:44.620
just feel I have to mention this okay

1073
0:35:44.620 --> 0:35:48.490
this is all for fun okay this this is

1074
0:35:48.490 --> 0:35:51.070
all for fun guys you know at the end of

1075
0:35:51.070 --> 0:35:53.590
the day they're fictional characters

1076
0:35:53.590 --> 0:35:56.020
coming up with you know concepts and

1077
0:35:56.020 --> 0:35:57.430
everything I had a lot of fun doing this

1078
0:35:57.430 --> 0:35:58.690
that'sthat's the reason I made the video

1079
0:35:58.690 --> 0:36:00.310
was because I'm like oh man if I can

1080
0:36:00.310 --> 0:36:02.380
think of you know like how would it get

1081
0:36:02.380 --> 0:36:03.880
to content show do against you know

1082
0:36:03.880 --> 0:36:05.530
Naruto but Norton has this but Ichigo

1083
0:36:05.530 --> 0:36:07.090
has that you know that that was fun for

1084
0:36:07.090 --> 0:36:08.800
me to make these videos it really was

1085
0:36:08.800 --> 0:36:10.180
but there are people out there I'm not

1086
0:36:10.180 --> 0:36:11.860
saying all of you but there are people

1087
0:36:11.860 --> 0:36:13.120
out there that take this to the next

1088
0:36:13.120 --> 0:36:13.570
level

1089
0:36:13.570 --> 0:36:16.270
I've seen many flame wars erupt in the

1090
0:36:16.270 --> 0:36:18.550
comment sections in videos talking about

1091
0:36:18.550 --> 0:36:20.050
this and then the forms and everything

1092
0:36:20.050 --> 0:36:22.120
and people cursing each other and like

1093
0:36:22.120 --> 0:36:25.180
you so bitch you know Naruto would lose

1094
0:36:25.180 --> 0:36:27.160
 ghost Ichigo right away you know this

1095
0:36:27.160 --> 0:36:28.720
is thick there's no need there's no call

1096
0:36:28.720 --> 0:36:30.310
or need for that okay there's no need

1097
0:36:30.310 --> 0:36:32.980
for you guys to write you know paragraph

1098
0:36:32.980 --> 0:36:36.250
after paragraph after paragraph oh this

1099
0:36:36.250 --> 0:36:37.780
some could be considered a short story

1100
0:36:37.780 --> 0:36:40.660
about just you berating somebody else

1101
0:36:40.660 --> 0:36:42.280
because they think somebody else would

1102
0:36:42.280 --> 0:36:44.470
win in a fight alright it's just it just

1103
0:36:44.470 --> 0:36:46.690
it really just makes so even if someone

1104
0:36:46.690 --> 0:36:49.210
were to to leave a comment on this and

1105
0:36:49.210 --> 0:36:50.380
you know you're wrong about everything

1106
0:36:50.380 --> 0:36:53.260
North ichigo would win no questions

1107
0:36:53.260 --> 0:36:55.120
asked i'm not gonna get butthurt over

1108
0:36:55.120 --> 0:36:57.310
that i'm not gonna get if someone leaves

1109
0:36:57.310 --> 0:36:58.840
a massive conman you know they call the

1110
0:36:58.840 --> 0:37:00.040
freaking curse words and beacon of free

1111
0:37:00.040 --> 0:37:02.470
control i'm not gonna get you know hurt

1112
0:37:02.470 --> 0:37:05.050
over that i'm not gonna sit here and cry

1113
0:37:05.050 --> 0:37:11.830
in my bed why did they say she go is

1114
0:37:11.830 --> 0:37:14.920
loose ain't she going down loose it's

1115
0:37:14.920 --> 0:37:17.050
the best he's awesome

1116
0:37:17.050 --> 0:37:19.780
he could use get to get that show he's

1117
0:37:19.780 --> 0:37:25.630
alright I love you Ichigo I love you

1118
0:37:25.630 --> 0:37:28.330
you're amazing you're amazing so I focus

1119
0:37:28.330 --> 0:37:29.890
the fuck out here I don't care about you

1120
0:37:29.890 --> 0:37:31.720
but Ichigo you're amazing in every way

1121
0:37:31.720 --> 0:37:34.510
shape or form so yeah just like this is

1122
0:37:34.510 --> 0:37:35.620
what you're trying to understand this is

1123
0:37:35.620 --> 0:37:37.930
not like my firm dogma and belief this

1124
0:37:37.930 --> 0:37:39.250
is not something I'm gonna like take to

1125
0:37:39.250 --> 0:37:41.080
my grave where it's like all my

1126
0:37:41.080 --> 0:37:42.460
tombstone it's gonna read you Naruto

1127
0:37:42.460 --> 0:37:44.500
Beauty go for the win you know it's not

1128
0:37:44.500 --> 0:37:46.000
going to be it's not going to be

1129
0:37:46.000 --> 0:37:48.550
something like that that's my firm

1130
0:37:48.550 --> 0:37:50.670
belief this is just me having fun

1131
0:37:50.670 --> 0:37:53.020
looking at their abilities comparing and

1132
0:37:53.020 --> 0:37:54.430
