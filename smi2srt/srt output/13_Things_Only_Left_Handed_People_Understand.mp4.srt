1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:01.829
this video is for all my left-handed

2
0:00:01.829 --> 0:00:05.850
people I see you I care today we're

3
0:00:05.850 --> 0:00:08.309
going to talk about 13 things that only

4
0:00:08.309 --> 0:00:10.679
us left-handed people would understand

5
0:00:10.679 --> 0:00:12.750
so left-handed people only make up about

6
0:00:12.750 --> 0:00:14.969
10 to 12 percent of the population and

7
0:00:14.969 --> 0:00:16.800
let's just say we have a huge learning

8
0:00:16.800 --> 0:00:19.020
curve when it comes to using things in

9
0:00:19.020 --> 0:00:21.590
getting used to things let's talk about

10
0:00:21.590 --> 0:00:25.949
number one scissors scissors seemed like

11
0:00:25.949 --> 0:00:27.900
a really handy dandy tool to have but

12
0:00:27.900 --> 0:00:29.760
frust left-handed people you need to

13
0:00:29.760 --> 0:00:32.130
know the struggle of finding a pair of

14
0:00:32.130 --> 0:00:34.530
left-handed scissors I didn't even know

15
0:00:34.530 --> 0:00:36.030
they made left-handed scissors until I

16
0:00:36.030 --> 0:00:37.230
was like in high school

17
0:00:37.230 --> 0:00:39.149
look at how difficult it can be to

18
0:00:39.149 --> 0:00:42.059
simply cut through a piece of paper and

19
0:00:42.059 --> 0:00:45.390
try to cut a straight line we are forced

20
0:00:45.390 --> 0:00:47.309
to basically hold them upside down if we

21
0:00:47.309 --> 0:00:49.260
can't even find a pair of left-handed

22
0:00:49.260 --> 0:00:51.510
scissors which in my classrooms they

23
0:00:51.510 --> 0:00:53.489
never even had and don't we all know

24
0:00:53.489 --> 0:00:55.620
about the anxiety of walking into a

25
0:00:55.620 --> 0:00:58.020
classroom and seeing these things we all

26
0:00:58.020 --> 0:01:00.870
know that familiar anxiety of scanning

27
0:01:00.870 --> 0:01:03.420
the room really quickly trying to find a

28
0:01:03.420 --> 0:01:06.990
left-handed desk so you either find one

29
0:01:06.990 --> 0:01:09.119
and run to it or you give up and you go

30
0:01:09.119 --> 0:01:11.159
and sit down and a desk that's designed

31
0:01:11.159 --> 0:01:13.049
for a right-handed person and then

32
0:01:13.049 --> 0:01:15.750
you're left kind of your ottoman and

33
0:01:15.750 --> 0:01:17.250
then you have two right there you

34
0:01:17.250 --> 0:01:18.990
position your body weird for the whole

35
0:01:18.990 --> 0:01:22.500
class what about mugs I mean we buy mugs

36
0:01:22.500 --> 0:01:24.869
with these cute sayings and we can't

37
0:01:24.869 --> 0:01:26.909
even see what's on it so there you are

38
0:01:26.909 --> 0:01:28.590
in the morning trying to enjoy a cup of

39
0:01:28.590 --> 0:01:30.659
coffee with a cute saying on it and you

40
0:01:30.659 --> 0:01:33.299
can't even enjoy it but the person

41
0:01:33.299 --> 0:01:35.820
you're drinking coffee with can what

42
0:01:35.820 --> 0:01:39.500
about kyun openers more like deathtrap

43
0:01:39.500 --> 0:01:42.869
thank God for these things can openers

44
0:01:42.869 --> 0:01:44.579
are definitely designed for right you

45
0:01:44.579 --> 0:01:46.110
need people if you try to open it up

46
0:01:46.110 --> 0:01:47.159
with your left hand it's basically

47
0:01:47.159 --> 0:01:49.619
upside down or your left trying to put

48
0:01:49.619 --> 0:01:52.170
it on really awkwardly so you either

49
0:01:52.170 --> 0:01:53.640
learn how to do it with your right hand

50
0:01:53.640 --> 0:01:56.159
or you buy those cans that you can

51
0:01:56.159 --> 0:01:58.200
easily open the lid on it you don't even

52
0:01:58.200 --> 0:02:00.780
realize how often that US left-handed

53
0:02:00.780 --> 0:02:05.250
people have to overcome or a dam what

54
0:02:05.250 --> 0:02:07.530
about jean zippers even jeans are

55
0:02:07.530 --> 0:02:09.239
designed for right-handed people you

56
0:02:09.239 --> 0:02:11.260
have to go in with your right hand open

57
0:02:11.260 --> 0:02:12.879
zipper if you go in with your left hand

58
0:02:12.879 --> 0:02:14.800
it gets real awkward and you have that

59
0:02:14.800 --> 0:02:16.540
flap you have to deal with what about

60
0:02:16.540 --> 0:02:19.120
the struggle of spiral notebooks my

61
0:02:19.120 --> 0:02:20.590
left-handers know what I'm talking about

62
0:02:20.590 --> 0:02:23.500
you walk around with that weird dent in

63
0:02:23.500 --> 0:02:27.280
your hand also what about binders you're

64
0:02:27.280 --> 0:02:28.510
left kind of trying to get in between

65
0:02:28.510 --> 0:02:31.629
the binder or work around it work about

66
0:02:31.629 --> 0:02:34.239
it it's just our what about pens and

67
0:02:34.239 --> 0:02:37.480
pencils we all know how it feels to be

68
0:02:37.480 --> 0:02:39.519
done writing your notes in class and you

69
0:02:39.519 --> 0:02:41.590
lift your hand up and nothing but silver

70
0:02:41.590 --> 0:02:43.959
and then you have to be careful not to

71
0:02:43.959 --> 0:02:46.569
smudge it on yourself on your face on

72
0:02:46.569 --> 0:02:48.129
your clothes while we're talking about

73
0:02:48.129 --> 0:02:50.379
pens or pencils we're about having to

74
0:02:50.379 --> 0:02:58.739
always read an upside-down detail huh

75
0:02:58.739 --> 0:03:00.940
that drives redo it you know and it's

76
0:03:00.940 --> 0:03:02.319
like they don't even want us to enjoy

77
0:03:02.319 --> 0:03:04.810
ice cream when you're right-handed you

78
0:03:04.810 --> 0:03:06.819
just scoop it nicely but when you're

79
0:03:06.819 --> 0:03:09.250
left-handed Oh what do you know you're

80
0:03:09.250 --> 0:03:10.840
putting your hands right in the ice

81
0:03:10.840 --> 0:03:12.790
cream it's pretty much impossible to

82
0:03:12.790 --> 0:03:15.970
scoop out the struggle I left a nurse

83
0:03:15.970 --> 0:03:19.030
now what about video games controllers

84
0:03:19.030 --> 0:03:20.950
are definitely made for right unit

85
0:03:20.950 --> 0:03:23.290
people so us left-handers have no choice

86
0:03:23.290 --> 0:03:25.209
but to overcome and learn how to

87
0:03:25.209 --> 0:03:27.250
kick-ass a little bit better than right

88
0:03:27.250 --> 0:03:29.139

computer and it's always on the

91
0:03:32.410 --> 0:03:34.630
right-hand side you have two options

92
0:03:34.630 --> 0:03:37.660
people you can either adjust it over to

93
0:03:37.660 --> 0:03:40.599
the left-hand side or you can just get

94
0:03:40.599 --> 0:03:43.180
used to using it on the right side it's

95
0:03:43.180 --> 0:03:45.130

0:03:45.130 --> 0:03:49.269
credit cards awkward what do you have to

97
0:03:49.269 --> 0:03:50.410
