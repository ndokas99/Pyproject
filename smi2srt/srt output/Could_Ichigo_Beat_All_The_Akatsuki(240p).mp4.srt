0:00:01.220 --> 0:00:04.410
hello everyone it is your host Seth the

2
0:00:04.410 --> 0:00:06.960
programmer and with me today I have my

3
0:00:06.960 --> 0:00:10.260
good ol pal collide and today we're

4
0:00:10.260 --> 0:00:12.090
gonna be talking about Ichigo versus the

5
0:00:12.090 --> 0:00:13.860
Akatsuki now we're doing this video

6
0:00:13.860 --> 0:00:16.020
because we need more bleach content on

7
0:00:16.020 --> 0:00:17.430
the channel we have our magnum opus

8
0:00:17.430 --> 0:00:19.710
coming in you know we're making Ichigo

9
0:00:19.710 --> 0:00:21.900
vs. Naruto fully animated and all that

10
0:00:21.900 --> 0:00:23.460
and it's a little bit weird that I've

11
0:00:23.460 --> 0:00:26.189
been binge reading and watching and all

12
0:00:26.189 --> 0:00:27.840
of this stuff for Bleach and I haven't

13
0:00:27.840 --> 0:00:29.730
made a single bleach related video

14
0:00:29.730 --> 0:00:32.430
really since moderate vs. Aizen so I

15
0:00:32.430 --> 0:00:34.260
decided to get the bleach guy you know

16
0:00:34.260 --> 0:00:36.270
Clyde on here and how are you doing

17
0:00:36.270 --> 0:00:38.640
today climb I'm doing fantastic Jeff

18
0:00:38.640 --> 0:00:39.840
thank you for having me on the channel

19
0:00:39.840 --> 0:00:41.910
once again so sad that I have spent the

20
0:00:41.910 --> 0:00:44.610
past good two or three days weary

21
0:00:44.610 --> 0:00:46.350
watched a heap of the fights from Bleach

22
0:00:46.350 --> 0:00:47.910
and also ran through them too so we can

23
0:00:47.910 --> 0:00:49.350
see if we could find any sort of things

24
0:00:49.350 --> 0:00:50.730
here and there South also found

25
0:00:50.730 --> 0:00:51.870
something very interesting which I'll

26
0:00:51.870 --> 0:00:53.160
talk about later on through the video

27
0:00:53.160 --> 0:00:55.379
and that is a few data book related

28
0:00:55.379 --> 0:00:57.210
things which bleach actually lacks if

29
0:00:57.210 --> 0:00:58.260
you're a bleach fan you'll know that

30
0:00:58.260 --> 0:01:00.090
it's quite hard to find a lot of our

31
0:01:00.090 --> 0:01:02.250
feet and speed and DC related stuff for

32
0:01:02.250 --> 0:01:03.449
Bleach because they just don't usually

33
0:01:03.449 --> 0:01:05.220
give it to us but Seth did find some

34
0:01:05.220 --> 0:01:06.810
very interesting data book related stuff

35
0:01:06.810 --> 0:01:08.070
and thanks to his friend who speaks

36
0:01:08.070 --> 0:01:09.810
fluent Japanese we were able to get a

37
0:01:09.810 --> 0:01:11.159
translated so that's something to look

38
0:01:11.159 --> 0:01:12.600
forward to with this video but I'm super

39
0:01:12.600 --> 0:01:14.670
happy to be on because we do have naruto

40
0:01:14.670 --> 0:01:16.320
vs ichigo coming later on through the

41
0:01:16.320 --> 0:01:17.729
year we're being hyping it up for almost

42
0:01:17.729 --> 0:01:20.460
two whole years and yeah a little bit

43
0:01:20.460 --> 0:01:21.900
longer than we thought but it will be

44
0:01:21.900 --> 0:01:23.939
worth it guys so I hope this video as a

45
0:01:23.939 --> 0:01:25.590
substitute for the time being because we

46
0:01:25.590 --> 0:01:27.119
haven't done any bleach content so once

47
0:01:27.119 --> 0:01:28.920
again thanks for having me on so as I

48
0:01:28.920 --> 0:01:30.540
hinted at the beginning of the video

49
0:01:30.540 --> 0:01:32.640
Clyde will be doing pretty much most of

50
0:01:32.640 --> 0:01:34.020
the belief stuff and I will be doing

51
0:01:34.020 --> 0:01:36.119
just about all of the Naruto stuff and

52
0:01:36.119 --> 0:01:38.610
after we kind of could join our opinions

53
0:01:38.610 --> 0:01:40.860
at the end then you'll hear the response

54
0:01:40.860 --> 0:01:42.420
but for now we're gonna kind of go over

55
0:01:42.420 --> 0:01:44.579
each of meta one-by-one we're only gonna

56
0:01:44.579 --> 0:01:46.170
be going over a power and speed very

57
0:01:46.170 --> 0:01:48.689
particularly right now but once we do

58
0:01:48.689 --> 0:01:50.880
our outro after the stats are down we'll

59
0:01:50.880 --> 0:01:53.100
talk more about hacks teamwork and

60
0:01:53.100 --> 0:01:54.180
what's going to happen with the

61
0:01:54.180 --> 0:01:56.130
characters so without further ado Clyde

62
0:01:56.130 --> 0:01:59.350
take it away

63
0:01:59.350 --> 0:02:01.450
to start off the scaling for each euro

64
0:02:01.450 --> 0:02:03.070
I'd like to dedicate the beginning of

65
0:02:03.070 --> 0:02:05.350
this segment by quickly debunking two

66
0:02:05.350 --> 0:02:06.820
things and the scaling of bleach that

67
0:02:06.820 --> 0:02:09.160
have become quite outdated and doesn't

68
0:02:09.160 --> 0:02:11.110
need to be used anymore when it comes to

69
0:02:11.110 --> 0:02:12.880
having bleaching verses matchups it's

70
0:02:12.880 --> 0:02:14.320
just really silly at this stage the

71
0:02:14.320 --> 0:02:16.810
first of those being gains bankai in the

72
0:02:16.810 --> 0:02:19.180
anime and manga of bleach gained spends

73
0:02:19.180 --> 0:02:21.370
the entire fight of each go trolling him

74
0:02:21.370 --> 0:02:23.200
while talking in code there's actually

75
0:02:23.200 --> 0:02:24.610
an interesting moment where each guy

76
0:02:24.610 --> 0:02:26.680
thinks he knows what gains bunk I can do

77
0:02:26.680 --> 0:02:28.959
but gain distinctly saves to himself in

78
0:02:28.959 --> 0:02:31.180
the monologue on the manga and in the

79
0:02:31.180 --> 0:02:33.310
anime that he is impressed by a ichigo's

80
0:02:33.310 --> 0:02:35.200
ability to come up with this hypothesis

81
0:02:35.200 --> 0:02:37.000
from the few encounters with the bankai

82
0:02:37.000 --> 0:02:39.340
though it is in fact incorrect many

83
0:02:39.340 --> 0:02:41.020
people use this to downplay bleach

84
0:02:41.020 --> 0:02:43.480
characters in speed 13 later tells eyes

85
0:02:43.480 --> 0:02:45.459
and his sword isn't as fast as he said

86
0:02:45.459 --> 0:02:47.830
nor is that even the swords main ability

87
0:02:47.830 --> 0:02:50.080
surprisingly people completely forget

88
0:02:50.080 --> 0:02:52.030
this game scene which blows my mind

89
0:02:52.030 --> 0:02:54.280
because it happens during a very

90
0:02:54.280 --> 0:02:56.200
important moment in the story it's

91
0:02:56.200 --> 0:02:58.420
almost impossible to miss not only just

92
0:02:58.420 --> 0:03:00.310
gain explicitly say that that's not how

93
0:03:00.310 --> 0:03:01.840
his sword works but we've seen better

94
0:03:01.840 --> 0:03:03.700
speed feats back in the soul society arc

95
0:03:03.700 --> 0:03:05.890
where each go can cut a majority of B

96
0:03:05.890 --> 0:03:08.170
Aki is 100 million blades and blocks a

97
0:03:08.170 --> 0:03:10.840
weapon that has the power of 3 million

98
0:03:10.840 --> 0:03:13.180
zanpakuto when it is in the process of

99
0:03:13.180 --> 0:03:15.010
executing an individual and let's be

100
0:03:15.010 --> 0:03:17.829
real for a second Ichigo is a 15 year

101
0:03:17.829 --> 0:03:19.750
old boy who only got his palace a few

102
0:03:19.750 --> 0:03:21.670
months ago he went from being relative

103
0:03:21.670 --> 0:03:24.549
to humans in speed to relative to

104
0:03:24.549 --> 0:03:27.160
literal death gods in speed the same way

105
0:03:27.160 --> 0:03:29.049
gains clapping analogy and presses the

106
0:03:29.049 --> 0:03:31.299
average fan of bleach is the same way

107
0:03:31.299 --> 0:03:33.010
that it impressed Ichigo

108
0:03:33.010 --> 0:03:34.299
the other thing I'd like to debunk

109
0:03:34.299 --> 0:03:36.489
really quick is this scan here which is

110
0:03:36.489 --> 0:03:38.380
from the Bleach official character book

111
0:03:38.380 --> 0:03:41.049
code of souls like lightning each very

112
0:03:41.049 --> 0:03:43.450
precious be Akio with godlike speed and

113
0:03:43.450 --> 0:03:45.790
attacks him at close range the problem

114
0:03:45.790 --> 0:03:47.769
with using this statement is that this

115
0:03:47.769 --> 0:03:49.540
is the equivalent to some mythological

116
0:03:49.540 --> 0:03:51.459
wording from folklore that we even

117
0:03:51.459 --> 0:03:52.810
actually use in our real world

118
0:03:52.810 --> 0:03:54.250
throughout history where you'll see

119
0:03:54.250 --> 0:03:55.810
plenty of stories use phrases like

120
0:03:55.810 --> 0:03:58.750
godlike lightning or heavenly power

121
0:03:58.750 --> 0:04:00.489
things along those nature right you know

122
0:04:00.489 --> 0:04:02.500
it's just there to sound impressive now

123
0:04:02.500 --> 0:04:04.959
the reason why using that data books can

124
0:04:04.959 --> 0:04:07.090
and especially the wording and taking it

125
0:04:07.090 --> 0:04:08.889
very hyper literal the reason why it's

126
0:04:08.889 --> 0:04:11.560
silly is because later on Bo

127
0:04:11.560 --> 0:04:13.780
keya blocks the attacks as shown in the

128
0:04:13.780 --> 0:04:15.790
data book itself right ambi akhiya then

129
0:04:15.790 --> 0:04:18.220
doubles his own speed later on and still

130
0:04:18.220 --> 0:04:20.169
can't catch each eager the reason they

131
0:04:20.169 --> 0:04:22.360
attach words like godlike or lightning

132
0:04:22.360 --> 0:04:24.070
or so on and so forth like I just talked

133
0:04:24.070 --> 0:04:26.650
about before with actual IRL folklore is

134
0:04:26.650 --> 0:04:28.210
because it's meant to be impressive and

135
0:04:28.210 --> 0:04:30.010
this is the first showing of ichigo's

136
0:04:30.010 --> 0:04:32.410
bankai on top of this the lieutenants

137
0:04:32.410 --> 0:04:34.810
and captains themselves actually show

138
0:04:34.810 --> 0:04:36.730
better feats and for Ichigo to be only

139
0:04:36.730 --> 0:04:38.950
seen as lightning speed when byakuya

140
0:04:38.950 --> 0:04:40.600
actually complements the speed of his

141
0:04:40.600 --> 0:04:42.790
bankai would be just a tad ridiculous

142
0:04:42.790 --> 0:04:45.040
surprisingly enough though light speed

143
0:04:45.040 --> 0:04:47.050
is actually the most consistent thing in

144
0:04:47.050 --> 0:04:48.910
the story of bleach as even shuhei

145
0:04:48.910 --> 0:04:51.070
hisagi is shown being able to dodge the

146
0:04:51.070 --> 0:04:53.169
nagashi on a beam of light used to

147
0:04:53.169 --> 0:04:55.120
actually save hollows meaning it spits

148
0:04:55.120 --> 0:04:57.520
it out of the sky as fast as possible to

149
0:04:57.520 --> 0:04:59.530
transport them back to hueco mundo if

150
0:04:59.530 --> 0:05:01.360
they're in danger and is constantly

151
0:05:01.360 --> 0:05:03.639
referred to as light by even the head

152
0:05:03.639 --> 0:05:06.250
captain who dismissively tells them not

153
0:05:06.250 --> 0:05:07.870
to bother trying to stop eyes and now

154
0:05:07.870 --> 0:05:10.240
after it covers gain Tosun and himself

155
0:05:10.240 --> 0:05:13.300
no no Issei is also able to tag x-axis

156
0:05:13.300 --> 0:05:15.190
as light and refers to the attacks as

157
0:05:15.190 --> 0:05:16.870
light multiple times throughout the

158
0:05:16.870 --> 0:05:19.120
actual fears translations yet she has no

159
0:05:19.120 --> 0:05:21.430
son poked her of her own and is probably

160
0:05:21.430 --> 0:05:23.890
weaker than the likes of Zeno soos gate

161
0:05:23.890 --> 0:05:25.810
Kermit Donny before she gets her royal

162
0:05:25.810 --> 0:05:27.640
family weapon and she is without a doubt

163
0:05:27.640 --> 0:05:29.620
weaker than the likes of Shi Kai each

164
0:05:29.620 --> 0:05:31.390
year from the soul society our crew has

165
0:05:31.390 --> 0:05:33.550
the power of around 3 million fodder

166
0:05:33.550 --> 0:05:36.220
saarebas as said before alongside the

167
0:05:36.220 --> 0:05:38.770
fact that Orihime can even react to you

168
0:05:38.770 --> 0:05:40.720
heart attacks and block them she was

169
0:05:40.720 --> 0:05:42.490
also shown in the hueco mundo art being

170
0:05:42.490 --> 0:05:44.229
able to tag someone who euros attacks

171
0:05:44.229 --> 0:05:45.789
when he was trying to hurt Ichigo and

172
0:05:45.789 --> 0:05:47.020
what's interesting about some of the

173
0:05:47.020 --> 0:05:48.580
things that she blocks is that these are

174
0:05:48.580 --> 0:05:50.229
attacks that are actually too fast for

175
0:05:50.229 --> 0:05:52.090
Ichigo to move out of the way this is

176
0:05:52.090 --> 0:05:54.220
the same Ichigo who could blitz Quincy

177
0:05:54.220 --> 0:05:55.840
girls who were leagues above little

178
0:05:55.840 --> 0:05:57.880
turtle um pod and she was shown being

179
0:05:57.880 --> 0:05:59.650
able to use hidden kalkaluru to flash

180
0:05:59.650 --> 0:06:02.110
over push another quincy out of the way

181
0:06:02.110 --> 0:06:04.060
and dodged the australian light the

182
0:06:04.060 --> 0:06:06.190
australian light is actually so fast

183
0:06:06.190 --> 0:06:08.229
that pretty much every single Quincy

184
0:06:08.229 --> 0:06:10.210
that it was aimed at was actually hit by

185
0:06:10.210 --> 0:06:12.460
the light itself even Busbee couldn't

186
0:06:12.460 --> 0:06:14.080
dodge delight and he was comparable to

187
0:06:14.080 --> 0:06:17.320
Shi Kai Yamamoto bankai Renji and even

188
0:06:17.320 --> 0:06:19.780
made Toshiro run away he also blitzed

189
0:06:19.780 --> 0:06:21.700
the same Quincy girls Ichigo was

190
0:06:21.700 --> 0:06:23.729
fighting by a one shotting every

191
0:06:23.729 --> 0:06:25.259
single one of them and these are the

192
0:06:25.259 --> 0:06:26.849
same girls that were giving kampachi

193
0:06:26.849 --> 0:06:28.680
trouble after his fight with Gremmie

194
0:06:28.680 --> 0:06:30.719
to put it simple any sorry far around

195
0:06:30.719 --> 0:06:32.610
the rank of code lieutenant level is

196
0:06:32.610 --> 0:06:35.249
most likely FTL quite casually and this

197
0:06:35.249 --> 0:06:36.960
is pretty crazy considering the null

198
0:06:36.960 --> 0:06:39.569
chad and orihime are able to perceive

199
0:06:39.569 --> 0:06:41.219
movements from characters who are far

200
0:06:41.219 --> 0:06:43.409
above them and massively faster than

201
0:06:43.409 --> 0:06:43.860
light

202
0:06:43.860 --> 0:06:46.259
now as for Ichigo speed however said

203
0:06:46.259 --> 0:06:47.550
that I will talk about that at the end

204
0:06:47.550 --> 0:06:50.189
of the video alongside many other FTL

205
0:06:50.189 --> 0:06:51.629
feats that you guys have definitely

206
0:06:51.629 --> 0:06:57.300
never heard of to go over the akatsuki

207
0:06:57.300 --> 0:06:59.009
speed the speed of Naruto is

208
0:06:59.009 --> 0:07:01.050
ever-evolving and honestly can have its

209
0:07:01.050 --> 0:07:02.969
own 30-minute video and still be missing

210
0:07:02.969 --> 0:07:05.039
some parts to it and since we have a lot

211
0:07:05.039 --> 0:07:06.719
of things to go over I'm gonna keep this

212
0:07:06.719 --> 0:07:08.069
as brief as possible since we're

213
0:07:08.069 --> 0:07:09.479
probably gonna go into more detail after

214
0:07:09.479 --> 0:07:11.969
we talk about the stats there are three

215
0:07:11.969 --> 0:07:14.339
metas to naruto speed one is that

216
0:07:14.339 --> 0:07:16.649
lightning timing is considered top-tier

217
0:07:16.649 --> 0:07:18.930
in the verse for joaneen Kakashi is a

218
0:07:18.930 --> 0:07:20.969
legend for cutting a lightning bolt here

219
0:07:20.969 --> 0:07:23.159
and is considered insanely fast by black

220
0:07:23.159 --> 0:07:25.379
zetsu who literally made the shinobi

221
0:07:25.379 --> 0:07:27.659
world and the fourth red COG a stated to

222
0:07:27.659 --> 0:07:29.789
have lightning-fast attacks in the data

223
0:07:29.789 --> 0:07:32.999
book - is the relativistic to light meta

224
0:07:32.999 --> 0:07:35.370
which is even if the fourth right cog a

225
0:07:35.370 --> 0:07:37.919
was low-balled to lightning speed Minato

226
0:07:37.919 --> 0:07:40.770
KCM Naruto and other characters are able

227
0:07:40.770 --> 0:07:43.560
to blitz him by dozens of times

228
0:07:43.560 --> 0:07:45.959
he's usually reach a few percentages of

229
0:07:45.959 --> 0:07:47.639
the speed of light due to such and this

230
0:07:47.639 --> 0:07:49.349
is usually accompanied by a ton of

231
0:07:49.349 --> 0:07:51.990
calculations and pixel scaling and so on

232
0:07:51.990 --> 0:07:54.659
the third is the Lightspeed meta in

233
0:07:54.659 --> 0:07:56.550
which you could point to many things in

234
0:07:56.550 --> 0:07:59.099
Naruto most specifically the data books

235
0:07:59.099 --> 0:08:00.509
that reference things as light such as

236
0:08:00.509 --> 0:08:03.599
Mifune is bijou cloak slashes Haku zeiss

237
0:08:03.599 --> 0:08:05.819
mirrors Dara's laser circus which

238
0:08:05.819 --> 0:08:07.770
refracts off of water particles like

239
0:08:07.770 --> 0:08:09.779
light and even the right car gaze larrya

240
0:08:09.779 --> 0:08:11.819
is described like light although it

241
0:08:11.819 --> 0:08:13.589
questionably contradicts the previous

242
0:08:13.589 --> 0:08:15.240
lightening statement you could make

243
0:08:15.240 --> 0:08:16.469
arguments that the light meta

244
0:08:16.469 --> 0:08:18.389
contradicts a few things such as Kakashi

245
0:08:18.389 --> 0:08:19.709
and the war getting blitz by a

246
0:08:19.709 --> 0:08:22.229
supposedly light speed Haku even though

247
0:08:22.229 --> 0:08:24.149
he should be able to keep up with a much

248
0:08:24.149 --> 0:08:26.490
faster than light Naruto using kauke's

249
0:08:26.490 --> 0:08:28.110
however these aren't important for this

250
0:08:28.110 --> 0:08:29.490
video for now we'll just give everyone

251
0:08:29.490 --> 0:08:30.870
to benefit from the doubt and say that

252
0:08:30.870 --> 0:08:32.250
the Akatsuki who scale pretty

253
0:08:32.250 --> 0:08:35.039
prominently to Kakashi stage Naruto and

254
0:08:35.039 --> 0:08:36.930
so forth would reach most of any of

255
0:08:36.930 --> 0:08:37.200
these

256
0:08:37.200 --> 0:08:39.060
metas at least in reaction or combat

257
0:08:39.060 --> 0:08:41.190
speed as sage mode is described by

258
0:08:41.190 --> 0:08:44.039
Naruto himself as being faster than KCM

259
0:08:44.039 --> 0:08:46.440
in reaction speeds with pain and obito

260
0:08:46.440 --> 0:08:47.940
being able to fight them and the last

261
0:08:47.940 --> 0:08:50.160
time Naruto fought when sage mode was

262
0:08:50.160 --> 0:08:53.420
versus the night tails and versus pain

263
0:08:53.420 --> 0:08:56.040
when talking about ichigo's destructive

264
0:08:56.040 --> 0:08:58.200
capacity or attack potency it's honestly

265
0:08:58.200 --> 0:09:00.210
quite straightforward and simple hueco

266
0:09:00.210 --> 0:09:01.950
mundo Ichigo after his battle with

267
0:09:01.950 --> 0:09:03.750
Grimmjow actually fights quite well

268
0:09:03.750 --> 0:09:05.430
against kruky aura this is the same

269
0:09:05.430 --> 0:09:07.170
earth you're her Grimmjow didn't want to

270
0:09:07.170 --> 0:09:08.730
fight to the point where he actually put

271
0:09:08.730 --> 0:09:10.350
him in a different dimension using the

272
0:09:10.350 --> 0:09:12.840
caja nagashi on now to do this in short

273
0:09:12.840 --> 0:09:14.610
every go Sparta is said to be able to

274
0:09:14.610 --> 0:09:16.170
destroy it lost no chairs with a cron

275
0:09:16.170 --> 0:09:18.480
race arrow this is a rule set by Aizen

276
0:09:18.480 --> 0:09:20.730
and directly stated by aruki aura Sasuke

277
0:09:20.730 --> 0:09:22.860
Aizen being the one from a society of

278
0:09:22.860 --> 0:09:25.200
1000 plus year-old super geniuses that

279
0:09:25.200 --> 0:09:26.790
are actually so intelligent that they

280
0:09:26.790 --> 0:09:28.650
can manipulate reality and life itself

281
0:09:28.650 --> 0:09:30.450
these thousand-year-old

282
0:09:30.450 --> 0:09:32.460
entities would be more than capable to

283
0:09:32.460 --> 0:09:34.350
be able to calculate reiatsu in basic

284
0:09:34.350 --> 0:09:35.790
physics when it comes to their own power

285
0:09:35.790 --> 0:09:38.490
Aizen was even able to calculate the

286
0:09:38.490 --> 0:09:41.100
exact percentage of how weak his crew he

287
0:09:41.100 --> 0:09:42.900
so he was compared to what it could be

288
0:09:42.900 --> 0:09:45.030
at its match potential Holly Bell struck

289
0:09:45.030 --> 0:09:46.980
Sione even comment that grim Jia

290
0:09:46.980 --> 0:09:48.330
shouldn't have released his grundrisse

291
0:09:48.330 --> 0:09:50.370
arrow against Ichigo while in his base

292
0:09:50.370 --> 0:09:52.650
form and Ichigo then goes on to fight

293
0:09:52.650 --> 0:09:54.540
rim jaw in his release state where his

294
0:09:54.540 --> 0:09:56.820
power and speed increases 5 to 10 times

295
0:09:56.820 --> 0:09:59.010
as our horror compares them to bankai

296
0:09:59.010 --> 0:10:00.930
and strength and the Espada's themselves

297
0:10:00.930 --> 0:10:02.910
alongside their sword cement anemic soul

298
0:10:02.910 --> 0:10:04.950
reapers and tight a coup bro describes

299
0:10:04.950 --> 0:10:07.290
them as a hollow parallel Buki auras

300
0:10:07.290 --> 0:10:09.480
base is then comparable to an Ichiro

301
0:10:09.480 --> 0:10:11.040
that's even stronger than this scrim gl

302
0:10:11.040 --> 0:10:13.200
as Aizen states that he masters his hala

303
0:10:13.200 --> 0:10:15.090
fication in this fight meaning earth ura

304
0:10:15.090 --> 0:10:17.040
is without a doubt as strong as released

305
0:10:17.040 --> 0:10:19.530
grim gel now Kuro should easily be this

306
0:10:19.530 --> 0:10:21.120
strong meaning he can destroy a lost no

307
0:10:21.120 --> 0:10:23.340
chairs 5 to 10 times over in his base

308
0:10:23.340 --> 0:10:26.100
form and if he uses his own run racer in

309
0:10:26.100 --> 0:10:27.510
base this could mean that he could have

310
0:10:27.510 --> 0:10:29.310
a several times increase in strength

311
0:10:29.310 --> 0:10:31.080
according to the data book which Seth

312
0:10:31.080 --> 0:10:33.360
actually found and translated himself it

313
0:10:33.360 --> 0:10:35.190
should also be noted that Grimmjow in

314
0:10:35.190 --> 0:10:37.020
his release Sayed actually has a tax

315
0:10:37.020 --> 0:10:39.000
that surpassed his own gran racer which

316
0:10:39.000 --> 0:10:40.830
he could use in his release state yet

317
0:10:40.830 --> 0:10:42.600
Ichigo is able to handle these

318
0:10:42.600 --> 0:10:44.670
tax and seems to be still relative to

319
0:10:44.670 --> 0:10:46.649
each euro so this is how it works

320
0:10:46.649 --> 0:10:48.930
euros base is five to ten times on snow

321
0:10:48.930 --> 0:10:50.550
chairs and destructive capacity times

322
0:10:50.550 --> 0:10:52.649
five to ten once again on top of that

323
0:10:52.649 --> 0:10:55.079
with his first release then another five

324
0:10:55.079 --> 0:10:56.730
three ten times on top of that with his

325
0:10:56.730 --> 0:10:59.220
second release and if lost no chairs is

326
0:10:59.220 --> 0:11:01.800
comparable to taxes Thailand and even a

327
0:11:01.800 --> 0:11:04.050
percentage of say Australia which is a

328
0:11:04.050 --> 0:11:06.180
conclusion most reach whether it's the

329
0:11:06.180 --> 0:11:08.040
scaling of ScrewAttack or even back when

330
0:11:08.040 --> 0:11:10.230
Seth and I rushed out motto reverses

331
0:11:10.230 --> 0:11:11.759
isin video within the span of three days

332
0:11:11.759 --> 0:11:14.040
or just you know goofy power scaling

333
0:11:14.040 --> 0:11:15.149
forums here and they're all over the

334
0:11:15.149 --> 0:11:17.880
internet they all come to a similar and

335
0:11:17.880 --> 0:11:21.509
song so if we use Texas and Akira is one

336
0:11:21.509 --> 0:11:23.610
thousand times his base in his second

337
0:11:23.610 --> 0:11:25.680
release he could easily destroy an area

338
0:11:25.680 --> 0:11:30.329
of 695 million square kilometers this is

339
0:11:30.329 --> 0:11:32.399
a very layman way to do it but it works

340
0:11:32.399 --> 0:11:35.300
now faster loading Ichigo absolutely

341
0:11:35.300 --> 0:11:37.769
stomps this second release earth Yura

342
0:11:37.769 --> 0:11:39.899
and thanks to SEFs research we found out

343
0:11:39.899 --> 0:11:41.759
that the vast oh lordy has to be at

344
0:11:41.759 --> 0:11:43.529
least ten times stronger than you are

345
0:11:43.529 --> 0:11:45.600
because Akira can counter one of its

346
0:11:45.600 --> 0:11:47.370
normal sorrows which Center or school

347
0:11:47.370 --> 0:11:49.800
does this is the only reason you are a

348
0:11:49.800 --> 0:11:51.389
even had a chance in the fight because

349
0:11:51.389 --> 0:11:53.130
the data books directly state that

350
0:11:53.130 --> 0:11:54.990
setter or Skoda's increases its attack

351
0:11:54.990 --> 0:11:57.240
by an order of magnitude orders of

352
0:11:57.240 --> 0:11:59.490
magnitude in physics and so forth being

353
0:11:59.490 --> 0:12:01.920
in order of ten therefore it has to be

354
0:12:01.920 --> 0:12:03.269
at least ten times greater than its

355
0:12:03.269 --> 0:12:04.860
normal power this is consistent

356
0:12:04.860 --> 0:12:06.839
considering grand race arrow which is

357
0:12:06.839 --> 0:12:08.519
stated to be several times great off

358
0:12:08.519 --> 0:12:10.680
several being times three and Akira

359
0:12:10.680 --> 0:12:12.630
introduces his London over lumbago and

360
0:12:12.630 --> 0:12:14.550
cetera Skouras as if they are more

361
0:12:14.550 --> 0:12:16.709
impressive in conclusion the Vasto Lorde

362
0:12:16.709 --> 0:12:18.660
a can easily destroy an area ten times

363
0:12:18.660 --> 0:12:20.579
that of the earth Yura calc which would

364
0:12:20.579 --> 0:12:23.519
be six billion nine hundred million

365
0:12:23.519 --> 0:12:25.920
square kilometers this also isn't even

366
0:12:25.920 --> 0:12:27.870
his max strength because the Vasto Lorde

367
0:12:27.870 --> 0:12:29.399
a wasn't even at full power when he

368
0:12:29.399 --> 0:12:31.500
fought her fury didn't use its own drum

369
0:12:31.500 --> 0:12:33.779
race arrow and it was easily able to

370
0:12:33.779 --> 0:12:36.149
crush and negate the lumps in Overland

371
0:12:36.149 --> 0:12:38.850
Park which our hero decides to use after

372
0:12:38.850 --> 0:12:40.649
his Center or schoolers release arrows

373
0:12:40.649 --> 0:12:42.240
and blacks arrows fail

374
0:12:42.240 --> 0:12:44.040
meaning it's obviously a stronger

375
0:12:44.040 --> 0:12:46.110
technique as I said before if we do

376
0:12:46.110 --> 0:12:48.060
include the fact that Ichigo can easily

377
0:12:48.060 --> 0:12:49.949
counter the Lanza door alone Parker

378
0:12:49.949 --> 0:12:52.110
plays him at full power with a non

379
0:12:52.110 --> 0:12:54.269
she-hulk sure as seen in ichigo's mind

380
0:12:54.269 --> 0:12:56.519
when he trains to beat Aizen and he uses

381
0:12:56.519 --> 0:12:59.339
his own run race error he is without a

382
0:12:59.339 --> 0:13:02.820
doubt ten times six billion nine hundred

383
0:13:02.820 --> 0:13:04.620
million square kilometers making him

384
0:13:04.620 --> 0:13:07.500
able to destroy or cover an area of 69

385
0:13:07.500 --> 0:13:10.110
billion five hundred million square

386
0:13:10.110 --> 0:13:10.950
kilometers

387
0:13:10.950 --> 0:13:12.930
this isn't wank either because the whole

388
0:13:12.930 --> 0:13:14.820
verse movie even comments on how his

389
0:13:14.820 --> 0:13:16.680
normal Saros that covered multiple

390
0:13:16.680 --> 0:13:18.870
layers of hell and blew open the doors

391
0:13:18.870 --> 0:13:20.760
of hell would inadvertently have an

392
0:13:20.760 --> 0:13:22.290
impact on the entire planet

393
0:13:22.290 --> 0:13:24.510
the vaster Lord a is casually considered

394
0:13:24.510 --> 0:13:27.180
a planetary threat by even Yamamoto who

395
0:13:27.180 --> 0:13:29.070
he himself can threaten all of these

396
0:13:29.070 --> 0:13:31.769
soul society while suppressed in the war

397
0:13:31.769 --> 0:13:34.140
which is actually a parallel world to

398
0:13:34.140 --> 0:13:37.050
the world of the living for destructive

399
0:13:37.050 --> 0:13:39.269
capacity or attack potency most

400
0:13:39.269 --> 0:13:41.130
calculations for the Akatsuki and their

401
0:13:41.130 --> 0:13:44.070
strongest jutsu tend to hit 10 to the 21

402
0:13:44.070 --> 0:13:46.380
joules which is usually considered

403
0:13:46.380 --> 0:13:48.600
enough to destroy small countries in

404
0:13:48.600 --> 0:13:50.760
terms of raw energy output and many of

405
0:13:50.760 --> 0:13:53.040
those are high bald like dataries z0

406
0:13:53.040 --> 0:13:54.990
including the shockwave of the blast and

407
0:13:54.990 --> 0:13:57.180
most coughs which reaches 20 kilometers

408
0:13:57.180 --> 0:13:59.070
in the data book in which they'll also

409
0:13:59.070 --> 0:14:01.410
add that that shockwave is actually how

410
0:14:01.410 --> 0:14:03.839
much it vaporizes to be generous some

411
0:14:03.839 --> 0:14:06.149
cows even go balls to the wall place

412
0:14:06.149 --> 0:14:08.370
pains to Baku Tensei at over 10 to the

413
0:14:08.370 --> 0:14:11.040
23 joules in place pains ship Baku

414
0:14:11.040 --> 0:14:13.440
Tensei and over 10 to the 23 joules of

415
0:14:13.440 --> 0:14:15.209
raw kinetic energy I've even seen some

416
0:14:15.209 --> 0:14:16.500
trying to place them at Continental

417
0:14:16.500 --> 0:14:18.480
other than this you have to make a lot

418
0:14:18.480 --> 0:14:20.250
of scaling assumptions to really get

419
0:14:20.250 --> 0:14:21.930
them higher like finding ways to scale

420
0:14:21.930 --> 0:14:23.310
the caste of the later war are

421
0:14:23.310 --> 0:14:25.110
characters like the ninetails who stated

422
0:14:25.110 --> 0:14:26.640
to be a threat to the entire planet

423
0:14:26.640 --> 0:14:28.740
numerous times in the data book however

424
0:14:28.740 --> 0:14:30.180
this is really work in a lot of

425
0:14:30.180 --> 0:14:31.890
instances and the ninetails tends to

426
0:14:31.890 --> 0:14:33.750
dominate any Akatsuki member comes

427
0:14:33.750 --> 0:14:35.730
across including the Chewbacca Tensei as

428
0:14:35.730 --> 0:14:37.500
well as the fact that stronger attacks

429
0:14:37.500 --> 0:14:40.079
like the c0 is tinct by Magda's body the

430
0:14:40.079 --> 0:14:42.329
sage snake who is rivaling more so a few

431
0:14:42.329 --> 0:14:44.010
tails at the version to nine-tailed

432
0:14:44.010 --> 0:14:46.019
cloak using Orochimaru rather than the

433
0:14:46.019 --> 0:14:48.420
actual full-blooded knight tales at the

434
0:14:48.420 --> 0:14:50.130
absolute best you might be able to get

435
0:14:50.130 --> 0:14:51.899
them to scale to killer B who in his

436
0:14:51.899 --> 0:14:53.459
eight tails state could sum out fight

437
0:14:53.459 --> 0:14:55.560
against the incomplete 10 tails however

438
0:14:55.560 --> 0:14:57.660
it's hard to say exactly how strong it

439
0:14:57.660 --> 0:14:59.339
was as gnar still had an even bully

440
0:14:59.339 --> 0:15:01.140
mastered his link with Kurama it was

441
0:15:01.140 --> 0:15:03.209
constantly low on stamina for a lot of

442
0:15:03.209 --> 0:15:04.930
that encounter giving the benefit

443
0:15:04.930 --> 0:15:06.160
now you could say that the eight-tails

444
0:15:06.160 --> 0:15:07.569
might be able to rival the multi

445
0:15:07.569 --> 0:15:09.040
continental attacks of the tenth tale

446
0:15:09.040 --> 0:15:10.389
that it could poop out although we've

447
0:15:10.389 --> 0:15:12.490
all seen how in reality the ten tails

448
0:15:12.490 --> 0:15:14.709
can kind of flick away anything the

449
0:15:14.709 --> 0:15:16.449
eight tails can actually do and even

450
0:15:16.449 --> 0:15:18.220
then it's hard to scale the Akatsuki to

451
0:15:18.220 --> 0:15:20.259
killer B anyway as even kisame who

452
0:15:20.259 --> 0:15:21.790
actually fought him one of the stronger

453
0:15:21.790 --> 0:15:23.709
members never actually took on a

454
0:15:23.709 --> 0:15:25.779
full-powered b and was constantly

455
0:15:25.779 --> 0:15:27.910
draining his power from him which would

456
0:15:27.910 --> 0:15:29.619
have made the gap close even further

457
0:15:29.619 --> 0:15:31.779
which would be more so an amped kisame

458
0:15:31.779 --> 0:15:34.209
if anything at best you might be able to

459
0:15:34.209 --> 0:15:34.509
say

460
0:15:34.509 --> 0:15:36.339
Obito might scale to the night tails

461
0:15:36.339 --> 0:15:38.350
since he could control it with his eyes

462
0:15:38.350 --> 0:15:40.329
when he was like 14 and that Minato

463
0:15:40.329 --> 0:15:43.149
thought that Naruto would need the night

464
0:15:43.149 --> 0:15:45.160
tails mastery and even then it might be

465
0:15:45.160 --> 0:15:48.429
questionable if he stands a chance all

466
0:15:48.429 --> 0:15:50.499
right fellas so I hope this HG reverses

467
0:15:50.499 --> 0:15:52.749
the Akatsuki video has lived up to its

468
0:15:52.749 --> 0:15:54.579
expectations we're being hyping it up

469
0:15:54.579 --> 0:15:56.110
for quite a while took a very long time

470
0:15:56.110 --> 0:15:58.869
to our make but it has been worth the

471
0:15:58.869 --> 0:16:00.490
long wait itself Seth do you want to

472
0:16:00.490 --> 0:16:01.899
give them a general rundown of how this

473
0:16:01.899 --> 0:16:02.920
fight would actually go down because

474
0:16:02.920 --> 0:16:04.149
we've covered everything to do with the

475
0:16:04.149 --> 0:16:05.740
Ecosse and Ichigo but how about the

476
0:16:05.740 --> 0:16:07.929
fight actually guard after the pole will

477
0:16:07.929 --> 0:16:09.339
break down to beat a and we briefly went

478
0:16:09.339 --> 0:16:11.110
over everything and look look how long

479
0:16:11.110 --> 0:16:13.120
the videos been and we still have so

480
0:16:13.120 --> 0:16:15.160
much more to go over so even with this

481
0:16:15.160 --> 0:16:16.480
outro we're still not gonna be able to

482
0:16:16.480 --> 0:16:17.829
go over everything so we're probably

483
0:16:17.829 --> 0:16:19.240
gonna be making more Naruto versus

484
0:16:19.240 --> 0:16:21.100
Bleach diverse content in the future to

485
0:16:21.100 --> 0:16:22.689
kind of go over more details but for now

486
0:16:22.689 --> 0:16:24.339
I'll keep it brief stats and speed

487
0:16:24.339 --> 0:16:27.069
comparison speed wise it's pretty it's

488
0:16:27.069 --> 0:16:28.990
pretty contentious it's like you could

489
0:16:28.990 --> 0:16:31.480
argue both of these forces are reaching

490
0:16:31.480 --> 0:16:34.149
a similar 10 to the 21 joules of

491
0:16:34.149 --> 0:16:36.249
destructive output or attack potency at

492
0:16:36.249 --> 0:16:39.189
their strongest or maybe more so higher

493
0:16:39.189 --> 0:16:41.410
for Ichigo especially using those okey

494
0:16:41.410 --> 0:16:43.540
doke Alex that Clyde presented earlier

495
0:16:43.540 --> 0:16:46.300
and it really should be noted that most

496
0:16:46.300 --> 0:16:48.850
of these attacks by the Akatsuki that do

497
0:16:48.850 --> 0:16:51.220
reach these country quote-unquote as the

498
0:16:51.220 --> 0:16:52.569
versus community would like to label

499
0:16:52.569 --> 0:16:54.879
that it usually requires most of their

500
0:16:54.879 --> 0:16:56.949
more powerful attacks like Daedra

501
0:16:56.949 --> 0:17:00.100
literally committing suicide pain giving

502
0:17:00.100 --> 0:17:02.980
himself like a brain hemorrhage while he

503
0:17:02.980 --> 0:17:04.959
tries to like hold down the night tails

504
0:17:04.959 --> 0:17:07.058
with this Chewbacca 10 say the Susanoo

505
0:17:07.058 --> 0:17:09.428
ripping Itachi's body apart things like

506
0:17:09.428 --> 0:17:11.319
that it's not necessarily casual whereas

507
0:17:11.319 --> 0:17:13.058
with Ichigo he's just doing it with

508
0:17:13.058 --> 0:17:14.589
every single attack he throws like a

509
0:17:14.589 --> 0:17:17.048
damn Dragon Ball character in speed like

510
0:17:17.048 --> 0:17:18.670
I said before it depends on what

511
0:17:18.670 --> 0:17:20.530
Mehta you're using and you really really

512
0:17:20.530 --> 0:17:22.839
have to give them both the benefit of

513
0:17:22.839 --> 0:17:24.339
the doubt for them to reach those 10

514
0:17:24.339 --> 0:17:25.870
through 100 times the speed of light

515
0:17:25.870 --> 0:17:28.569
ranges but they do bulk tend to reach

516
0:17:28.569 --> 0:17:30.670
near those areas if you hai bought the

517
0:17:30.670 --> 0:17:32.140
Akatsuki and you really give them the

518
0:17:32.140 --> 0:17:33.700
method now it's actually easier than it

519
0:17:33.700 --> 0:17:35.470
is for Ichigo because each go requires

520
0:17:35.470 --> 0:17:37.750
more assumptions however the power

521
0:17:37.750 --> 0:17:39.700
difference is still there and obviously

522
0:17:39.700 --> 0:17:42.010
attack range and stamina goes in

523
0:17:42.010 --> 0:17:43.450
ichigo's favor Ichigo has enough stamina

524
0:17:43.450 --> 0:17:45.220
to fight for months on end without

525
0:17:45.220 --> 0:17:47.020
stopping rest the Akatsuki their

526
0:17:47.020 --> 0:17:49.060
strongest attacks defy ichigo with their

527
0:17:49.060 --> 0:17:51.100
really not doing a whole lot so it

528
0:17:51.100 --> 0:17:52.570
doesn't really matter even if you did

529
0:17:52.570 --> 0:17:55.090
wank off the akatsuki speed in that area

530
0:17:55.090 --> 0:17:56.800
now as I mentioned earlier the hell

531
0:17:56.800 --> 0:17:58.540
verse stuff is actually very important

532
0:17:58.540 --> 0:18:00.070
for this video because it really slaps

533
0:18:00.070 --> 0:18:02.290
into people's faces that the Vasto Lorde

534
0:18:02.290 --> 0:18:04.810
8 is planet level and Kubo takes things

535
0:18:04.810 --> 0:18:07.150
from the filler the movies and it kind

536
0:18:07.150 --> 0:18:08.830
of works in the same way when it comes

537
0:18:08.830 --> 0:18:11.020
to canonicity as dragon ball does where

538
0:18:11.020 --> 0:18:12.670
toe a and p rot have sort of an

539
0:18:12.670 --> 0:18:14.500
influence over bleach and dragon bolt

540
0:18:14.500 --> 0:18:15.790
they can sort of add things into the

541
0:18:15.790 --> 0:18:17.170
story with the movies crew bo approves

542
0:18:17.170 --> 0:18:18.460
them if you just like some stuff he'll

543
0:18:18.460 --> 0:18:19.900
maybe comment on them here and there

544
0:18:19.900 --> 0:18:21.160
which is i think people are gonna bring

545
0:18:21.160 --> 0:18:22.630
up when it comes to how verse movie but

546
0:18:22.630 --> 0:18:24.490
he is directly credited in the opening

547
0:18:24.490 --> 0:18:26.410
and the actual cover of the movie itself

548
0:18:26.410 --> 0:18:28.030
so we have no reason to distrust that

549
0:18:28.030 --> 0:18:29.290
and considering the fact that he does

550
0:18:29.290 --> 0:18:31.240
use stuff directly from the filler and

551
0:18:31.240 --> 0:18:33.550
the actual movie 1 and puts it into the

552
0:18:33.550 --> 0:18:35.590
manga it's like well it's not only

553
0:18:35.590 --> 0:18:37.180
muster dispute here is there sir you

554
0:18:37.180 --> 0:18:38.770
have yamamoto confirming his planet

555
0:18:38.770 --> 0:18:40.540
level ichigo is anywhere from 10 through

556
0:18:40.540 --> 0:18:42.490
a hundred times the speed of light he's

557
0:18:42.490 --> 0:18:43.960
easily you know as i said planet level

558
0:18:43.960 --> 0:18:45.670
once again not looking too good and

559
0:18:45.670 --> 0:18:47.680
that's pretty much in for the Canon of

560
0:18:47.680 --> 0:18:50.770
the movie itself yeah so Canon is a very

561
0:18:50.770 --> 0:18:54.820
subjective in broad area of debate and

562
0:18:54.820 --> 0:18:56.740
once again could have its own video but

563
0:18:56.740 --> 0:18:59.470
in this case Canon is just more so can

564
0:18:59.470 --> 0:19:01.330
it be used during the discussion there

565
0:19:01.330 --> 0:19:02.950
are obviously like particular

566
0:19:02.950 --> 0:19:04.600
definitions of Canon which this wouldn't

567
0:19:04.600 --> 0:19:06.610
apply to however in this case it does

568
0:19:06.610 --> 0:19:08.380
apply I do believe and as Clyde

569
0:19:08.380 --> 0:19:10.150
described now the reason we bring this

570
0:19:10.150 --> 0:19:12.250
up is obviously Ichigo himself in that

571
0:19:12.250 --> 0:19:14.080
movie actually thought that his hollow

572
0:19:14.080 --> 0:19:16.090
form was enough to destroy the whole

573
0:19:16.090 --> 0:19:16.630
world

574
0:19:16.630 --> 0:19:19.360
and Yamamoto actually credits Ichigo for

575
0:19:19.360 --> 0:19:21.160
cutting something that everyone thought

576
0:19:21.160 --> 0:19:23.590
was uncuttable yamamoto being a being

577
0:19:23.590 --> 0:19:25.900
who's so powerful he can destroy the

578
0:19:25.900 --> 0:19:27.970
planet by standing there believes they

579
0:19:27.970 --> 0:19:30.070
were uncuttable as well so that is also

580
0:19:30.070 --> 0:19:32.169
something to think about now even

581
0:19:32.169 --> 0:19:34.299
you do just say like maybe that's too

582
0:19:34.299 --> 0:19:36.340
big and Ichigo does get offed there's

583
0:19:36.340 --> 0:19:38.919
obviously the war arced Ichigo which his

584
0:19:38.919 --> 0:19:42.039
base form is rivaling his vast Oh Lord a

585
0:19:42.039 --> 0:19:43.600
state pretty casually at least in the

586
0:19:43.600 --> 0:19:45.070
statement of you ha and then he can

587
0:19:45.070 --> 0:19:47.529
multiply all his stats by over 30 times

588
0:19:47.529 --> 0:19:49.629
using a bankai which is ten times him

589
0:19:49.629 --> 0:19:50.710
but obviously his several-fold

590
0:19:50.710 --> 0:19:52.450
multiplier of his grand race arrows and

591
0:19:52.450 --> 0:19:54.129
then obviously his speed would go up by

592
0:19:54.129 --> 0:19:55.629
ten times as well and there's just

593
0:19:55.629 --> 0:19:57.489
really no way for the Akatsuki to reach

594
0:19:57.489 --> 0:19:59.169
those levels if it was more arc and you

595
0:19:59.169 --> 0:20:01.269
would really have to just deny ichigo's

596
0:20:01.269 --> 0:20:03.039
Vasto Lorde a lor now other than that

597
0:20:03.039 --> 0:20:05.739
there are hacks the Akatsuki have like

598
0:20:05.739 --> 0:20:08.019
sasori's poison which I will hand over

599
0:20:08.019 --> 0:20:09.759
to Clyde for that one now I know a lot

600
0:20:09.759 --> 0:20:11.200
of Naruto fans are gonna bring up the

601
0:20:11.200 --> 0:20:12.999
idea that well if they work as a quote

602
0:20:12.999 --> 0:20:14.919
team with all the we've all heard the

603
0:20:14.919 --> 0:20:16.720
meme of you know the teamwork stuff they

604
0:20:16.720 --> 0:20:18.429
could probably poison Ichigo and then he

605
0:20:18.429 --> 0:20:19.779
just gets named from that because

606
0:20:19.779 --> 0:20:21.220
there's nothing he can do well sadly

607
0:20:21.220 --> 0:20:22.960
when Seth and I went through bleach once

608
0:20:22.960 --> 0:20:24.519
again we noticed that up if you have

609
0:20:24.519 --> 0:20:26.049
high enough we're out so you can negate

610
0:20:26.049 --> 0:20:28.239
poisons because Yami does it to a frosty

611
0:20:28.239 --> 0:20:29.739
owner who covers his body with this

612
0:20:29.739 --> 0:20:31.119
poison that can actually a road a

613
0:20:31.119 --> 0:20:33.700
concrete also Ichigo is able to fight

614
0:20:33.700 --> 0:20:35.859
against gain who gains bankai it stated

615
0:20:35.859 --> 0:20:38.440
that his actual poison can erode cells

616
0:20:38.440 --> 0:20:40.149
when he gets clipped by the bankai

617
0:20:40.149 --> 0:20:41.649
itself he explains his two eyes and by

618
0:20:41.649 --> 0:20:43.149
each go does get stabbed by the bankai

619
0:20:43.149 --> 0:20:44.710
and yet he doesn't take any damage from

620
0:20:44.710 --> 0:20:46.929
the poison so it's not looking too good

621
0:20:46.929 --> 0:20:48.279
when it comes to that so I wouldn't have

622
0:20:48.279 --> 0:20:49.840
too much confidence in poison if I were

623
0:20:49.840 --> 0:20:51.519
you guys personally I don't believe that

624
0:20:51.519 --> 0:20:53.799
game's poison touched Ichigo but that is

625
0:20:53.799 --> 0:20:55.749
something to consider that it might have

626
0:20:55.749 --> 0:20:57.549
raised him when it went by but the

627
0:20:57.549 --> 0:21:00.009
fractions poison being so strong it

628
0:21:00.009 --> 0:21:02.019
dissolves concrete is a little bit

629
0:21:02.019 --> 0:21:03.669
different than salary's poison which

630
0:21:03.669 --> 0:21:05.679
probably just attacks like via proteins

631
0:21:05.679 --> 0:21:07.570
in the body I mean if they could tank

632
0:21:07.570 --> 0:21:10.600
that much more potent physical poison I

633
0:21:10.600 --> 0:21:11.830
don't really see any evidence that

634
0:21:11.830 --> 0:21:14.139
acessories work now other than that

635
0:21:14.139 --> 0:21:16.869
there is data receive alms

636
0:21:16.869 --> 0:21:18.850
now in this debate we are obviously

637
0:21:18.850 --> 0:21:21.249
saying okay the Akatsuki can see Ichigo

638
0:21:21.249 --> 0:21:22.629
otherwise they're fighting a an

639
0:21:22.629 --> 0:21:24.789
invisible spirit man that they don't

640
0:21:24.789 --> 0:21:26.769
even know exists now you could say that

641
0:21:26.769 --> 0:21:29.259
chakra is spiritual in nature and

642
0:21:29.259 --> 0:21:31.659
therefore they can sense Ichigo however

643
0:21:31.659 --> 0:21:33.399
if you grant that benefit of the doubt

644
0:21:33.399 --> 0:21:35.259
to the Akatsuki then Ichigo can see

645
0:21:35.259 --> 0:21:37.029
chakra because chakra is spiritual in

646
0:21:37.029 --> 0:21:38.799
nature as well if you're linking one

647
0:21:38.799 --> 0:21:40.359
thing yet the link the other and in this

648
0:21:40.359 --> 0:21:42.009
case Ichigo would be able to see the

649
0:21:42.009 --> 0:21:43.749
bombs and then there's even the argument

650
0:21:43.749 --> 0:21:45.510
whether it effect each go regardless

651
0:21:45.510 --> 0:21:47.190
I mean it didn't even rip apart Mondas

652
0:21:47.190 --> 0:21:49.560
body and Monda is considered weaker than

653
0:21:49.560 --> 0:21:51.600
Orochimaru if he had his arms and as

654
0:21:51.600 --> 0:21:54.090
well as the fact that Monda is in

655
0:21:54.090 --> 0:21:56.430
Orochimaru or more so rivaling Naruto

656
0:21:56.430 --> 0:21:59.040
with a few tales of diversion to nine

657
0:21:59.040 --> 0:22:01.410
tails cloak not anywhere close to the

658
0:22:01.410 --> 0:22:03.000
full thing so it's really once again

659
0:22:03.000 --> 0:22:04.890
hard to argue that they would do

660
0:22:04.890 --> 0:22:07.200
anything now next there's pain and zetsu

661
0:22:07.200 --> 0:22:09.780
now pain and zetsu and obito they do

662
0:22:09.780 --> 0:22:12.060
kind of scale to that late war era if

663
0:22:12.060 --> 0:22:13.800
you use the fact that pain was stealing

664
0:22:13.800 --> 0:22:15.150
away the nine tails there's more

665
0:22:15.150 --> 0:22:17.070
arguments than that but just keeping it

666
0:22:17.070 --> 0:22:19.080
brief he is able to maybe like hold down

667
0:22:19.080 --> 0:22:20.580
the eight tails of the nine tails which

668
0:22:20.580 --> 0:22:22.050
is pretty considerable since it's a

669
0:22:22.050 --> 0:22:24.360
planet Buster in its full state zetsu

670
0:22:24.360 --> 0:22:25.950
who was so powerful that he was able to

671
0:22:25.950 --> 0:22:28.500
amp Obito to fight late war Kakashi

672
0:22:28.500 --> 0:22:30.990
Minato and a lesser zetsu was able to

673
0:22:30.990 --> 0:22:32.970
hold off the whole shinobi alliance so

674
0:22:32.970 --> 0:22:35.040
these two characters once again even if

675
0:22:35.040 --> 0:22:36.750
they do beat master Lord a they're

676
0:22:36.750 --> 0:22:39.840
getting negged once again by war arc

677
0:22:39.840 --> 0:22:42.120
ichigo they do not have the same brow

678
0:22:42.120 --> 0:22:44.820
busting or speed feats to really compete

679
0:22:44.820 --> 0:22:47.310
with that unfortunately next is Itachi's

680
0:22:47.310 --> 0:22:50.220
genjutsu Itachi's genjutsu unfortunately

681
0:22:50.220 --> 0:22:54.060
while it may work on a jinchuriki as

682
0:22:54.060 --> 0:22:56.730
implied by Naruto with his tsukuyomi at

683
0:22:56.730 --> 0:22:58.440
least there's no evidence that it would

684
0:22:58.440 --> 0:23:00.780
work on Ichigo who has two spirits and

685
0:23:00.780 --> 0:23:02.640
both of those spirits are more than

686
0:23:02.640 --> 0:23:04.470
likely more powerful than the Bijou

687
0:23:04.470 --> 0:23:07.170
within a jinchuriki especially a lesser

688
0:23:07.170 --> 0:23:08.640
jinchuriki not even the nine tails

689
0:23:08.640 --> 0:23:10.140
jinchuuriki this would also apply to

690
0:23:10.140 --> 0:23:12.420
Obito who as a koto a matsutake like

691
0:23:12.420 --> 0:23:14.760
genjutsu he placed on yara so the

692
0:23:14.760 --> 0:23:16.410
problem with those theories is that

693
0:23:16.410 --> 0:23:18.990
obviously the genjutsu placed on yagura

694
0:23:18.990 --> 0:23:20.850
or Filas placed on the eight tails would

695
0:23:20.850 --> 0:23:22.530
not be nearly the same as if it was

696
0:23:22.530 --> 0:23:24.060
placed on the nine tails as we've seen

697
0:23:24.060 --> 0:23:27.030
even Madra you see ah in his battle with

698
0:23:27.030 --> 0:23:30.660
hoshi Rama or Obito versus Minato Minato

699
0:23:30.660 --> 0:23:33.060
states if he's anything like Madara he

700
0:23:33.060 --> 0:23:34.980
cannot hold the nine tails for very long

701
0:23:34.980 --> 0:23:36.690
and his genjutsu and it is known

702
0:23:36.690 --> 0:23:38.310
throughout the land the holding the nine

703
0:23:38.310 --> 0:23:40.110
tails and again jutsu is insanely

704
0:23:40.110 --> 0:23:42.030
difficult despite the fact that the

705
0:23:42.030 --> 0:23:43.800
tailed beasts are constantly put under

706
0:23:43.800 --> 0:23:45.630
genjutsu including the eight tails he

707
0:23:45.630 --> 0:23:47.580
was put under again jutsu by Orochimaru

708
0:23:47.580 --> 0:23:48.900
at least in filler and he doesn't even

709
0:23:48.900 --> 0:23:50.550
have a Sharingan and then obviously

710
0:23:50.550 --> 0:23:53.250
there's the toast Keyblade and I'll let

711
0:23:53.250 --> 0:23:55.050
Clyde go for that one now as for the

712
0:23:55.050 --> 0:23:56.910
telescope blade it's um it's a little

713
0:23:56.910 --> 0:23:57.990
bit weird because

714
0:23:57.990 --> 0:23:59.490
people could say that it kind of works

715
0:23:59.490 --> 0:24:01.020
the same way as some pop Tories doing

716
0:24:01.020 --> 0:24:03.120
bleep so it may not even affect Ichigo

717
0:24:03.120 --> 0:24:04.500
for that matter or we could even make

718
0:24:04.500 --> 0:24:06.300
the argument that he's even too quick to

719
0:24:06.300 --> 0:24:08.280
even be hit by the thing and if they if

720
0:24:08.280 --> 0:24:09.870
the Akatsuki themselves are to seal

721
0:24:09.870 --> 0:24:11.730
Ichigo with that with a slash way Itachi

722
0:24:11.730 --> 0:24:13.320
is already you know in pain from using

723
0:24:13.320 --> 0:24:15.059
the Susanoo itself it isn't looking too

724
0:24:15.059 --> 0:24:17.400
good and on top of that it uh it isn't

725
0:24:17.400 --> 0:24:19.830
really a fair thing to say that it could

726
0:24:19.830 --> 0:24:22.020
exactly cut just anybody because that

727
0:24:22.020 --> 0:24:23.820
would be a quote no-limits fallacy

728
0:24:23.820 --> 0:24:25.380
considering that Kakashi's lightning

729
0:24:25.380 --> 0:24:26.850
blade is actually sated that our

730
0:24:26.850 --> 0:24:28.800
Kakashi's arm becomes a famous blade

731
0:24:28.800 --> 0:24:31.320
that can cut through anything through

732
0:24:31.320 --> 0:24:34.200
anything so if we went to wank the Tasca

733
0:24:34.200 --> 0:24:37.410
blade it's it is a bit unfair to give it

734
0:24:37.410 --> 0:24:38.850
that much credit I just don't think it's

735
0:24:38.850 --> 0:24:40.290
gonna be as handy as a lot of people are

736
0:24:40.290 --> 0:24:41.970
gonna say in this battle and on top of

737
0:24:41.970 --> 0:24:43.320
that like even just hitting Hur lines

738
0:24:43.320 --> 0:24:45.300
gonna be too much trouble yeah obviously

739
0:24:45.300 --> 0:24:47.910
the Tosca blade it attacks things you

740
0:24:47.910 --> 0:24:49.710
have to stab them for it to seal not

741
0:24:49.710 --> 0:24:51.720
even just cut however obviously when it

742
0:24:51.720 --> 0:24:52.980
comes to the war aki geo yet the

743
0:24:52.980 --> 0:24:55.260
peruvian fast and then you have to prove

744
0:24:55.260 --> 0:24:56.910
once again that it actually has the

745
0:24:56.910 --> 0:24:58.559
power required to cut someone on that

746
0:24:58.559 --> 0:25:00.240
level you can't just have a no limits

747
0:25:00.240 --> 0:25:01.590
fallacy where you can just cut through

748
0:25:01.590 --> 0:25:02.520
absolutely everything especially

749
0:25:02.520 --> 0:25:04.200
universe like bleach where hacks are

750
0:25:04.200 --> 0:25:06.240
negated by raw power and obviously it

751
0:25:06.240 --> 0:25:07.830
goes back to Kakashi and Kakashi she's a

752
0:25:07.830 --> 0:25:09.420
character who couldn't even he couldn't

753
0:25:09.420 --> 0:25:11.160
even cut through like most of the

754
0:25:11.160 --> 0:25:13.140
version to Jin Turkey he did cut through

755
0:25:13.140 --> 0:25:14.309
a lot of them however there are many

756
0:25:14.309 --> 0:25:15.840
instances where it was more like who's

757
0:25:15.840 --> 0:25:17.550
throwing a hard punch like next to a guy

758
0:25:17.550 --> 0:25:19.530
so it is a little bit weird to use that

759
0:25:19.530 --> 0:25:21.660
comparison that also goes back to Hidan

760
0:25:21.660 --> 0:25:24.420
Ichigo has a zanpakuto which is a Soul

761
0:25:24.420 --> 0:25:26.760
cutter and it actually attacks you on a

762
0:25:26.760 --> 0:25:27.870
spiritual level

763
0:25:27.870 --> 0:25:30.840
so if Ichigo were to annihilate or fully

764
0:25:30.840 --> 0:25:32.460
attack he'd on who does not have the

765
0:25:32.460 --> 0:25:33.780
durability to withstand any of his

766
0:25:33.780 --> 0:25:35.670
attacks he not is not getting up from it

767
0:25:35.670 --> 0:25:37.500
his soul will be annihilated and his

768
0:25:37.500 --> 0:25:39.600
body will be vaporized even if he was

769
0:25:39.600 --> 0:25:41.160
immortal we have seen that he Don's body

770
0:25:41.160 --> 0:25:43.050
isn't like majin buu where we like

771
0:25:43.050 --> 0:25:44.970
recovers or like regenerates itself

772
0:25:44.970 --> 0:25:47.100
instantly yes have conquers you put back

773
0:25:47.100 --> 0:25:48.660
on his head and stuff like that so if

774
0:25:48.660 --> 0:25:50.760
his body is like atomized or he's just

775
0:25:50.760 --> 0:25:53.010
completely removed from existence which

776
0:25:53.010 --> 0:25:54.420
Quincy's are actually able to remove

777
0:25:54.420 --> 0:25:56.250
people from existence let alone Ichigo

778
0:25:56.250 --> 0:25:58.140
who is also his Quincy powers it's not

779
0:25:58.140 --> 0:25:59.760
looking good for hidan same would go for

780
0:25:59.760 --> 0:26:02.730
a kakuzu and Conan they aren't really

781
0:26:02.730 --> 0:26:03.840
doing much either especially since

782
0:26:03.840 --> 0:26:05.730
they're raw power based fighters and

783
0:26:05.730 --> 0:26:07.980
Ichigo has more raw power and months

784
0:26:07.980 --> 0:26:09.300
more stamina than they do

785
0:26:09.300 --> 0:26:10.420
yeah just weak

786
0:26:10.420 --> 0:26:12.370
Modern Warfare 2 claymore said I been

787
0:26:12.370 --> 0:26:13.990
doing she's a filler character in this

788
0:26:13.990 --> 0:26:15.940
one and finally just one more thing to

789
0:26:15.940 --> 0:26:17.440
mention is that a lot of people will say

790
0:26:17.440 --> 0:26:19.210
just like the Tosca blade well what if

791
0:26:19.210 --> 0:26:21.280
Ichigo gets thrown in obito's karma we

792
0:26:21.280 --> 0:26:22.750
dimension well there are some big issues

793
0:26:22.750 --> 0:26:24.640
that Obito has and that's that not only

794
0:26:24.640 --> 0:26:26.530
can hollows especially at the level of

795
0:26:26.530 --> 0:26:27.820
earth your own above which Ichigo

796
0:26:27.820 --> 0:26:29.650
absolutely is in the wake of mondo saga

797
0:26:29.650 --> 0:26:32.320
let alone the the war arc okay he can

798
0:26:32.320 --> 0:26:34.210
literally just break out of a dimension

799
0:26:34.210 --> 0:26:36.220
and he could also open up the nagashi on

800
0:26:36.220 --> 0:26:37.480
which hollows can do they could just

801
0:26:37.480 --> 0:26:39.130
open up a portal and leave if you want

802
0:26:39.130 --> 0:26:40.960
to blank ichigo's Shinigami form I don't

803
0:26:40.960 --> 0:26:42.100
even know if he can do this but he could

804
0:26:42.100 --> 0:26:43.810
technically open up the senkaimon and

805
0:26:43.810 --> 0:26:45.820
leave so he's got like three options

806
0:26:45.820 --> 0:26:47.440
there may be two of you know two at best

807
0:26:47.440 --> 0:26:48.640
but still yeah there's nothing that

808
0:26:48.640 --> 0:26:50.020
Obito can do to him either so not

809
0:26:50.020 --> 0:26:51.640
looking too good once again at the end

810
0:26:51.640 --> 0:26:54.100
of the day Ichigo is more of a rival to

811
0:26:54.100 --> 0:26:56.560
the Akatsuki and as a spark I don't care

812
0:26:56.560 --> 0:26:58.240
if you think the akatsuki beats a spot

813
0:26:58.240 --> 0:27:00.010
our Ichigo if you think a spot our key

814
0:27:00.010 --> 0:27:01.840
Ichigo beats the Akatsuki I just want us

815
0:27:01.840 --> 0:27:04.390
all to universally agree the war arc

816
0:27:04.390 --> 0:27:06.220
what's that which of course we'll be

817
0:27:06.220 --> 0:27:08.560
going into more detail in naruto vs

818
0:27:08.560 --> 0:27:10.420
ichigo and other than that speaking of

819
0:27:10.420 --> 0:27:12.340
naruto if you guys want to see in naruto

820
0:27:12.340 --> 0:27:14.140
versus the Espada maybe you can go over

821
0:27:14.140 --> 0:27:15.970
which arcs of Naruto compared to the

822
0:27:15.970 --> 0:27:18.730
Espada then it hit us up wall gladly do

823
0:27:18.730 --> 0:27:20.050
that as well and in the meantime check

824
0:27:20.050 --> 0:27:21.910
out moderate IRS's the Akatsuki if

825
0:27:21.910 --> 0:27:23.560
you're looking for more inverse scaling

826
0:27:23.560 --> 0:27:37.830
until next time
