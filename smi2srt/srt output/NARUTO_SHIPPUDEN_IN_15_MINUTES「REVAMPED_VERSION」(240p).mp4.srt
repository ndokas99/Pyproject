0:00:06.760 --> 0:00:08.920
♪ This is about to be so cringy. ♪

3
0:00:08.920 --> 0:00:17.440
*Weeb cover of Naruto Shippuden OP1*

4
0:00:17.440 --> 0:00:18.320
ARE YOU READY!?

5
0:00:18.320 --> 0:00:19.440
To start Naruto Shippuden off

6
0:00:19.440 --> 0:00:21.087
Naruto returns to the hidden leaf village

7
0:00:21.087 --> 0:00:22.270
after training with Jiraiya for two and a half years.

8
0:00:22.270 --> 0:00:23.575
He later gets reacquainted with

9
0:00:23.575 --> 0:00:25.630
Uselessness and Kakashi and undergoes the Bell Test,

10
0:00:25.630 --> 0:00:27.970
and as a result Naruto and Uselessness successfully

11
0:00:27.970 --> 0:00:30.110
pass the Bell Test, and acquire both bells.

12
0:00:30.110 --> 0:00:31.440
Meanwhile in the Hidden Sand Village

13
0:00:31.440 --> 0:00:33.640
Gaara is captured by an Akatsuki member named Deidara.

14
0:00:33.640 --> 0:00:34.763
With that said, Kankuro goes after

15
0:00:34.763 --> 0:00:36.230
Deidara to retrieve Gaara.

16
0:00:36.230 --> 0:00:37.870
Sit your weak ass down.

17
0:00:37.870 --> 0:00:39.820
After some time Kankuro catches up to Deidara,

18
0:00:39.820 --> 0:00:41.807
and is forced to go up against his partner Sasori.

19
0:00:41.807 --> 0:00:43.470
Sasori then poisons that bitch,

20
0:00:43.470 --> 0:00:44.630
and then leaves him there to die.

21
0:00:44.630 --> 0:00:47.106
A little after Hidden Sand Shinobi recovers Kankuro

22
0:00:47.106 --> 0:00:47.950
and brings him to an infirmary.

23
0:00:47.950 --> 0:00:49.350
At this point in time the Hidden Leaf Village

24
0:00:49.350 --> 0:00:50.610
is notified by the situation

25
0:00:50.610 --> 0:00:52.610
and dispatches Naruto, Kakashi, Uselessness,

26
0:00:52.610 --> 0:00:54.590
Temari, and Team Guy to rescue Gaara.

27
0:00:54.590 --> 0:00:56.160
But time is ticking because Gaara

28
0:00:56.160 --> 0:00:57.670
is getting extracted from his Tailed Beast.

29
0:00:57.670 --> 0:00:59.160
On the arrival at the hidden sand,

30
0:00:59.160 --> 0:01:01.250
Naruto's squad visits Kankuro's infirmary room

31
0:01:01.250 --> 0:01:03.830
where this random old bitch attacks them.

32
0:01:03.830 --> 0:01:06.120
This old bitch is later identified as Chiyo.

33
0:01:06.120 --> 0:01:08.020
While in the infirmary Uselessness creates

34
0:01:08.020 --> 0:01:09.420
antidotes for Sasori's poison.

35
0:01:09.420 --> 0:01:11.470
Also curing Kankuro from the effects of it.

36
0:01:11.470 --> 0:01:13.470
So moving forward Naruto's squad heads out,

37
0:01:13.470 --> 0:01:14.870
leaving Temari in the Hidden Sand

38
0:01:14.870 --> 0:01:16.040
and bringing Chiyo along.

39
0:01:16.040 --> 0:01:17.670
As both Team Guy and Naruto's squad

40
0:01:17.670 --> 0:01:19.030
arrive at the Akatsuki hideout,

41
0:01:19.030 --> 0:01:20.860
Gaara dies from his Tailed Beast being extracted.

42
0:01:20.860 --> 0:01:23.670
Gaara: How you gonna kill me off in the first season.

43
0:01:23.670 --> 0:01:24.750
They then breach the hideout,

44
0:01:24.750 --> 0:01:26.373
and there's Deidara and Sasori.

45
0:01:26.373 --> 0:01:27.870
Deidara takes Gaara and then flies away,

46
0:01:27.870 --> 0:01:29.580
beating Naruto and Kakashi out of the hideout.

47
0:01:29.580 --> 0:01:32.180
This left Uselessness and Chiyo to handle Sasori.

48
0:01:32.180 --> 0:01:43.760
*Pokémon battle music playing*

49
0:01:43.760 --> 0:01:44.800
(Rest in peace)

50
0:01:44.800 --> 0:01:46.250
Moving forward Naruto and Kakashi

51
0:01:46.250 --> 0:01:47.213
manages to recover Gaara.

52
0:01:47.213 --> 0:01:49.390
Deidara attempts to escape but then gets cornered

53
0:01:49.390 --> 0:01:50.490
until he self destructs.

54
0:01:50.490 --> 0:01:52.800
As a response Kakashi uses his mangekyou sharingan

55
0:01:52.800 --> 0:01:55.170
to absorb the explosion, ultimately saving everyone.

56
0:01:55.170 --> 0:01:56.710
With granny Chiyo having nothing to live for

57
0:01:56.710 --> 0:01:58.500
because she already has one fucking foot in the grave,

58
0:01:58.500 --> 0:01:59.990
she then uses the reanimation jutsu

59
0:01:59.990 --> 0:02:01.880
sacrificing her life to save Gaara.

60
0:02:01.880 --> 0:02:02.990
(Rest in peace)

61
0:02:02.990 --> 0:02:04.990
After all that everyone returned to their village,

62
0:02:04.990 --> 0:02:07.580
and lived happily ever after.

63
0:02:07.580 --> 0:02:08.600
For now.

64
0:02:08.600 --> 0:02:10.020
And oh yeah, Deidara is still alive

65
0:02:10.020 --> 0:02:11.700
and gets a new partner named Tobi.

66
0:02:11.700 --> 0:02:16.420
*Weeb cover of Naruto Shippuden OP2*

67
0:02:16.420 --> 0:02:17.950
Moving forward, Naruto is assigned a mission

68
0:02:17.950 --> 0:02:19.520
with Uselesness, Yamato, and Sai.

69
0:02:19.520 --> 0:02:21.207
Yamato is the substitute leader for Team Kakashi,

70
0:02:21.207 --> 0:02:23.440
and Sai's just there to paint fucking animals.

71
0:02:23.440 --> 0:02:24.640
They're assigned to go to Tenchi bridge

72
0:02:24.640 --> 0:02:26.100
to capture Sasori's spy.

73
0:02:26.100 --> 0:02:27.930
On their arrival Yamato approaches the bridge

74
0:02:27.930 --> 0:02:30.980
disguised as Hiruko, or Sasori's fucking puppet.

75
0:02:30.980 --> 0:02:32.570
Shortly after, Orochimaru appears and

76
0:02:32.570 --> 0:02:34.750
Kabuto karate chops the fuck out of Yamato.

77
0:02:34.750 --> 0:02:36.170
With that said, Naruto, Uselessness,

78
0:02:36.170 --> 0:02:37.590
and Sai assemble on the bridge.

79
0:02:37.590 --> 0:02:39.090
Orochimaru then provokes Naruto

80
0:02:39.090 --> 0:02:40.920
pushing him to enter the kyuubi cloak form.

81
0:02:40.920 --> 0:02:42.520
(Sakura gets rekt)

82
0:02:42.520 --> 0:02:44.300
As a resolution to stop Naruto's rampage,

83
0:02:44.300 --> 0:02:46.870
Yamato uses the Hokage Style: Elder Jutsu

84
0:02:46.870 --> 0:02:48.040
Tenth Edict on Enlightment.

85
0:02:48.040 --> 0:02:50.039
While that's happening, Sai groups up with

86
0:02:50.039 --> 0:02:51.630
Orochimaru and Kabuto and heads to their hideout.

87
0:02:51.630 --> 0:02:53.810
Using a clone, Yamato traces them down to the hideout

88
0:02:53.810 --> 0:02:55.040
and given the clone's assistance,

89
0:02:55.040 --> 0:02:56.650
Naruto, Uselessness, and Yamato enter.

90
0:02:56.650 --> 0:02:57.960
Soon after they find Sai, and search

91
0:02:57.960 --> 0:02:59.030
room to room for Sasuke.

92
0:02:59.030 --> 0:03:01.002
Sai finds Sasuke and attempts to capture him.

93
0:03:01.002 --> 0:03:10.720
(door creaks open)

94
0:03:10.720 --> 0:03:12.580
Sasuke: Think it's funny waking me from my wet dream.

95
0:03:12.580 --> 0:03:15.160
Sai: *gasps*

96
0:03:15.160 --> 0:03:20.640
(Sai's snakes hissing)

97
0:03:20.640 --> 0:03:21.720
*KA-BOOM*

98
0:03:21.720 --> 0:03:23.000
Naruto, Uselessness, and Yamato

99
0:03:23.000 --> 0:03:24.830
then rushes to Sasuke's location.

100
0:03:24.830 --> 0:03:26.890
After a nice little reunion, Sasuke obliterates

101
0:03:26.890 --> 0:03:28.950
all of them, and retreats with Orochimaru and Kabuto.

102
0:03:28.950 --> 0:03:30.470
Returning to the Hidden Leaf, Naruto undergoes

103
0:03:30.470 --> 0:03:32.330
intense training for chakra nature and chakra form

104
0:03:32.330 --> 0:03:34.010
with the intention of creating a new jutsu.

105
0:03:34.010 --> 0:03:35.560
At this time two Akatsuki members

106
0:03:35.560 --> 0:03:37.420
Hidan and Kakuzu are invading the Land of Fire,

107
0:03:37.420 --> 0:03:38.560
killing innocent Shinobi.

108
0:03:38.560 --> 0:03:40.240
As a result, Team Asuma and a couple

109
0:03:40.240 --> 0:03:41.440
another Shinobi are dispatched.

110
0:03:41.440 --> 0:03:43.493
Attempting to kill Hidan, Asuma dies.

111
0:03:43.493 --> 0:03:44.540
Rest in peace!

112
0:03:44.540 --> 0:03:46.727
Soon after reinforcements come, a bit fucking late,

113
0:03:46.727 --> 0:03:48.480
and both Hidan and Kakuzu retreat.

114
0:03:48.480 --> 0:03:49.770
Shikamaru then seeks vengeance and

115
0:03:49.770 --> 0:03:52.320
goes after them once again with Ino, Choji, and Kakashi.

116
0:03:52.320 --> 0:03:53.697
They manage to ambush Hidan and Kakuzu,

117
0:03:53.697 --> 0:03:55.427
and so Shikamaru uses his shadow possession jutsu

118
0:03:55.427 --> 0:03:58.510
on Hidan and leaves him here, where he can fuck his shit up.

119
0:03:58.510 --> 0:04:00.707
Moments after, Naruto arrives at the battlefield and is like

120
0:04:00.707 --> 0:04:02.690
&quot;hey, I'm about to fuck your spaghetti ass up&quot;,

121
0:04:02.690 --> 0:04:05.080
and uses his new jutsu wind style rasen shuriken

122
0:04:05.080 --> 0:04:06.410
to defeat Kakuzu.

123
0:04:06.410 --> 0:04:07.270
Rest in peace!

124
0:04:07.270 --> 0:04:09.110
And at this current moment, Shikamaru successfully

125
0:04:09.110 --> 0:04:11.740
traps Hidan blowing his body up to a fuck ton of pieces

126
0:04:11.740 --> 0:04:13.170
leaving him a hole to die.

127
0:04:13.170 --> 0:04:14.100
Rest in peace!

128
0:04:14.100 --> 0:04:15.940
Moving forward Orochimaru is in a weakened state

129
0:04:15.940 --> 0:04:16.880
and needs a new vessel.

130
0:04:16.880 --> 0:04:19.680
Sasuke takes advantage of this and kills Orochimaru.

131
0:04:19.680 --> 0:04:21.739
Sasuke then gathers three members for the Hebi.

132
0:04:21.739 --> 0:04:23.150
Karin, Jugo, and Suigetsu.

133
0:04:23.150 --> 0:04:25.220
While searching for Itachi, Sasuke's ambushed by Deidara.

134
0:04:25.220 --> 0:04:26.970
Sasuke then fucks his shit up,

135
0:04:26.970 --> 0:04:29.430
causing Deidara to self destruct as a last resort.

136
0:04:29.430 --> 0:04:31.032
Rest in peace!

137
0:04:31.032 --> 0:04:32.380
This causes a massive explosion in which

138
0:04:32.380 --> 0:04:33.670
Sasuke manages to escape.

139
0:04:33.670 --> 0:04:35.590
At this current point, the Hidden Leaf dispatches

140
0:04:35.590 --> 0:04:38.040
Team Kakashi and Team Kurenai to capture Sasuke.

141
0:04:38.040 --> 0:04:40.040
While searching for Sasuke, Naruto finds himself

142
0:04:40.040 --> 0:04:43.010
bumping into Itachi where he receives a gift from him.

143
0:04:43.010 --> 0:04:44.890
Moving forward, while this whole search for Sasuke

144
0:04:44.890 --> 0:04:46.980
thing is going on, Jiraiya leaves the Hidden Leaf Village

145
0:04:46.980 --> 0:04:48.240
to investigate the Hidden Rain

146
0:04:48.240 --> 0:04:49.620
for information on the Akatsuki.

147
0:04:49.620 --> 0:04:51.020
While on this mission Jiraiya had to fight

148
0:04:51.020 --> 0:04:52.730
his former student Konan and a little after

149
0:04:52.730 --> 0:04:53.620
he had to fight Pain.

150
0:04:53.620 --> 0:04:55.030
Both members of the Akatsuki.

151
0:04:55.030 --> 0:04:56.963
And as a result, Jiraiya dies.

152
0:04:56.963 --> 0:04:58.000
Rest in peace!

153
0:04:58.000 --> 0:04:59.160
But right on the brink of death,

154
0:04:59.160 --> 0:05:01.440
Jiraiya sends intel on Pain to the Hidden Leaf.

155
0:05:01.440 --> 0:05:04.080
So our boy Jiraiya didn't die for no reason.

156
0:05:04.080 --> 0:05:05.740
Moving forward, Sasuke gets the location where

157
0:05:05.740 --> 0:05:07.910
he can find Itachi through one of Itachi's clones.

158
0:05:07.910 --> 0:05:09.830
So Sasuke goes to the location he was told,

159
0:05:09.830 --> 0:05:12.070
and on his way he crosses paths with Kisame.

160
0:05:12.070 --> 0:05:13.810
Kisame allows Sasuke through but prevents

161
0:05:13.810 --> 0:05:15.670
Jugo, Karin, and Suigetsu to follow.

162
0:05:15.670 --> 0:05:17.180
As Sasuke enters the Uchiha hideout,

163
0:05:17.180 --> 0:05:18.650
there he sees his brother Itachi.

164
0:05:18.650 --> 0:05:21.605
They then fight and Sasuke ends up using his strongest jutsu

165
0:05:21.605 --> 0:05:24.610
(lightning and dramatic music)

166
0:05:24.610 --> 0:05:26.800
Sasuke: I call this jutsu Kirin,

167
0:05:26.800 --> 0:05:30.519
now be gone with the booty clap BITCH.

168
0:05:30.519 --> 0:05:32.409
(lightning)

169
0:05:32.409 --> 0:05:34.160
(roars)

170
0:05:34.160 --> 0:05:35.900
Itachi: Did he just say boo—?

171
0:05:35.900 --> 0:05:38.050
So then Itachi then gets back up using his susanoo,

172
0:05:38.050 --> 0:05:39.767
and through desperation Sasuke tries to force chakra,

173
0:05:39.767 --> 0:05:42.980
resulting in the curse mark unleashing this monstrosity.

174
0:05:42.980 --> 0:05:44.240
Orichamaru then plays peek-a-boo

175
0:05:44.240 --> 0:05:47.030
and Itachi smacks that bitch with the totsuka blade.

176
0:05:47.030 --> 0:05:48.260
Feeling that curse mark away,

177
0:05:48.260 --> 0:05:52.231
shortly after Itachi collapses as well as Sasuke.

178
0:05:52.231 --> 0:05:54.920
Oh yeah Itachi died by the way.

179
0:05:54.920 --> 0:05:55.950
Rest in peace!

180
0:05:55.950 --> 0:05:58.780
Tobi then captures Sasuke and tells him the truth of Itachi,

181
0:05:58.780 --> 0:06:00.080
which is that Itachi was just trying to

182
0:06:00.080 --> 0:06:01.950
protect Sasuke in the Hidden Leaf Village.

183
0:06:01.950 --> 0:06:04.470
After hearing this Sasuke unlocks his mangekyou sharingan

184
0:06:04.470 --> 0:06:06.670
and sets the goal to destroy the Hidden Leaf Village.

185
0:06:06.670 --> 0:06:07.590
Sasuke then joins the Akatsuki

186
0:06:07.590 --> 0:06:09.367
in which he's then assigned to capture the

187
0:06:09.367 --> 0:06:10.750
atl Jinchuuriki killer bee.

188
0:06:10.750 --> 0:06:12.800
He successfully defeats and captures killer bee,

189
0:06:12.800 --> 0:06:14.850
but later on it's revealed that he captured a clone.

190
0:06:14.850 --> 0:06:16.770
Moving forward, Naruto returns to the Hidden Leaf

191
0:06:16.770 --> 0:06:18.120
and now gets the news about Jiraiya.

192
0:06:18.120 --> 0:06:19.890
He falls into a depression, but then eventually

193
0:06:19.890 --> 0:06:21.360
overcomes it, and then undergoes training

194
0:06:21.360 --> 0:06:23.352
for senjutsu at Mount Myoboku.

195
0:06:23.352 --> 0:06:24.360
While Naruto is training at Mount Myoboku,

196
0:06:24.360 --> 0:06:25.840
the Hidden Leaf is attacked by Pain

197
0:06:25.840 --> 0:06:27.520
and eventually annihilated.

198
0:06:27.520 --> 0:06:29.407
Naruto then appears after mastering senjutsu,

199
0:06:29.407 --> 0:06:32.060
and takes on all of the six Pains at once.

200
0:06:32.060 --> 0:06:34.250
Like the DISGUSTING beast he is.

201
0:06:34.250 --> 0:06:35.730
After destroying five of the six Pains,

202
0:06:35.730 --> 0:06:36.941
Naruto is then pinned.

203
0:06:36.941 --> 0:06:42.300
Hinata then comes to the rescue but, yeah.

204
0:06:42.300 --> 0:06:43.940
After witnessing this, Naruto only sees

205
0:06:43.940 --> 0:06:47.320
his kyuubi cloak form, reaching a whole six tails.

206
0:06:47.320 --> 0:06:49.610
Through desperation, Naruto attempts to release nine tails,

207
0:06:49.610 --> 0:06:51.770
but is then stopped by his father Minato.

208
0:06:51.770 --> 0:06:53.480
Minato then suppresses the kyuubi chakra,

209
0:06:53.480 --> 0:06:54.950
leaving Naruto to do one thing.

210
0:06:54.950 --> 0:06:56.560
SMACK THAT BITCH WITH A RASENGAN

211
0:06:56.560 --> 0:06:58.560
Upon defeating Pain, Naruto utilizes sage mode

212
0:06:58.560 --> 0:07:00.080
and one of Pain's black rods to track

213
0:07:00.080 --> 0:07:01.690
the individual who is controlling Pain.

214
0:07:01.690 --> 0:07:03.830
Naruto locates the person and discovers that it was

215
0:07:03.830 --> 0:07:05.850
one of Jiraiya's former students, Nagato.

216
0:07:05.850 --> 0:07:07.580
Given the situation, Naruto then gives

217
0:07:07.580 --> 0:07:10.620
one of his POWERFUL speeches, which brings Nagato to believe

218
0:07:10.620 --> 0:07:13.790
Naruto has the power to bring peace to the Shinobi world.

219
0:07:13.790 --> 0:07:15.370
Nagato then uses Rinne Rebirth,

220
0:07:15.370 --> 0:07:19.090
reviving everyone who died in the Pain asssault.

221
0:07:19.090 --> 0:07:20.840
Oh yeah, Nagato dies in the process.

222
0:07:20.840 --> 0:07:21.700
Rest in peace!

223
0:07:21.700 --> 0:07:27.560
*Weeb cover of Naruto Shippuden OP8*

224
0:07:27.560 --> 0:07:29.370
Moving forward, Naruto returns to the

225
0:07:29.370 --> 0:07:30.780
Hidden Leaf Village as a hero,

226
0:07:30.780 --> 0:07:32.610
and due to the fact Tsunade was placed

227
0:07:32.610 --> 0:07:34.150
under a coma from the Pain assault,

228
0:07:34.150 --> 0:07:37.000
Danzo was assigned hokage, best hokage right here boys.

229
0:07:37.000 --> 0:07:38.980
With that said, Sasuke sees the five hokage summit

230
0:07:38.980 --> 0:07:40.850
as an opportunity to kill Danzo.

231
0:07:40.850 --> 0:07:42.700
Taking on four hokages, Sasuke pushes

232
0:07:42.700 --> 0:07:43.870
his way to get to Danzo.

233
0:07:43.870 --> 0:07:46.270
But mid battle, the fighting is then disrupted by Tobi.

234
0:07:46.270 --> 0:07:48.200
Tobi then declares the fourth great ninja war,

235
0:07:48.200 --> 0:07:50.120
explaining his ultimate goal, Project Tsuki No Me.

236
0:07:50.120 --> 0:07:53.040
Naruto: Uh Sakura, what was that?

237
0:07:53.040 --> 0:07:54.880
What did you just say?

238
0:07:54.880 --> 0:07:58.360
Sakura: What I said was, I love you Naruto.

239
0:07:58.360 --> 0:08:01.240
(Get the fuck outta here with yo lying ass)

240
0:08:01.240 --> 0:08:03.050
Tobi then transports Sasuke to Danzo,

241
0:08:03.050 --> 0:08:05.350
leaving Danzo no other choice but to fight.

242
0:08:05.350 --> 0:08:08.010
Placed in a predicament, Danzo then takes Karin hostage

243
0:08:08.010 --> 0:08:09.520
and with Sasuke being Sasuke...

244
0:08:09.520 --> 0:08:11.820
Karin: Sasuke help! Do something!

245
0:08:11.820 --> 0:08:13.580
Sasuke: No worries, I got you.

246
0:08:13.580 --> 0:08:14.520
(lightning beams)

247
0:08:14.520 --> 0:08:16.020
As a last resort Danzo uses his

248
0:08:16.020 --> 0:08:17.700
Reverse Tetragram Sealing Jutsu,

249
0:08:17.700 --> 0:08:20.500
self destructing, and... killing no one.

250
0:08:20.500 --> 0:08:22.160
(laughter)

251
0:08:22.160 --> 0:08:23.360
Rest in peace!

252
0:08:23.360 --> 0:08:25.200
Uselessness then shows up trying to kill Sasuke,

253
0:08:25.200 --> 0:08:27.650
but nearly dies if it wasn't for Kakashi.

254
0:08:27.650 --> 0:08:29.010
Kakashi and Sasuke then fight,

255
0:08:29.010 --> 0:08:30.960
and Uselessness goes in for the round two,

256
0:08:30.960 --> 0:08:33.250
but this bitch nearly dies again

257
0:08:33.250 --> 0:08:34.430
if it wasn't for Naruto.

258
0:08:34.430 --> 0:08:36.760
So after that, Naruto and Sasuke then have a brief talk,

259
0:08:36.760 --> 0:08:39.289
and shortly after that Sasuke and Tobi retreat.

260
0:08:39.289 --> 0:08:40.740
With Sasuke's eyes being all fucked up from

261
0:08:40.740 --> 0:08:42.090
overusing the sharingan, he then decides to get

262
0:08:42.090 --> 0:08:44.210
Itachi's eyes implanted, enabling him to

263
0:08:44.210 --> 0:08:45.820
acquire the Enternal Mangekyou Sharingan.

264
0:08:45.820 --> 0:08:47.640
Moving forward, Tsunade wakes from her coma,

265
0:08:47.640 --> 0:08:48.700
and is reassigned Hokage.

266
0:08:48.700 --> 0:08:50.550
With that said, Naruto is then assigned to go to

267
0:08:50.550 --> 0:08:51.900
Turtle Island along with Killer Bee

268
0:08:51.900 --> 0:08:53.370
to prevent them from getting captured

269
0:08:53.370 --> 0:08:54.760
and extracted from the Tailed Beast.

270
0:08:54.760 --> 0:08:56.150
Yamato and Guy also come along,

271
0:08:56.150 --> 0:08:57.520
and Naruto is not aware of the plan

272
0:08:57.520 --> 0:08:59.520
and is told that this is a S rank mission.

273
0:08:59.520 --> 0:09:01.750
On Turtle Island, Naruto fights the nine tails within him,

274
0:09:01.750 --> 0:09:03.430
attempting to conquer is kyuubi chakra.

275
0:09:03.430 --> 0:09:05.072
With the help of his mother Kushina,

276
0:09:05.072 --> 0:09:07.010
Naruto defeats the nine tails, and acquires kyuubi mode.

277
0:09:07.010 --> 0:09:09.090
And shortly after, Kisame appears from the Samahada

278
0:09:09.090 --> 0:09:10.630
that Killer Bee has been carrying around.

279
0:09:10.630 --> 0:09:13.050
Attempting to escape, Kisame is intercepted by Guy.

280
0:09:13.050 --> 0:09:14.830
At the brink of being extracted for information,

281
0:09:14.830 --> 0:09:16.530
Kisame summons water strikes to consume him,

282
0:09:16.530 --> 0:09:18.450
preventing any information from getting leaked.

283
0:09:18.450 --> 0:09:20.340
Also, at the mist of dove, Kisame uses a

284
0:09:20.340 --> 0:09:22.100
water strike summoning to send intel on the

285
0:09:22.100 --> 0:09:24.500
Jinjuuriki's location to Kabuto and Tobi,

286
0:09:24.500 --> 0:09:27.020
who are now acquaintances, and oh yeah.

287
0:09:27.020 --> 0:09:28.243
Rest in peace!

288
0:09:28.243 --> 0:09:30.410
Moving forward, Tobi is looking Nagato's corpse

289
0:09:30.410 --> 0:09:31.243
so he can acquire the rinnegan.

290
0:09:31.243 --> 0:09:33.720
He then goes to Konan asking her where she put the body

291
0:09:33.720 --> 0:09:35.470
but she refuses, and attempts to kill him.

292
0:09:35.470 --> 0:09:37.380
Tobi was not having it and defeats Konan

293
0:09:37.380 --> 0:09:39.330
placing her under a genjutsu forcing her to

294
0:09:39.330 --> 0:09:41.150
reveal the location of Nagato's body.

295
0:09:41.150 --> 0:09:42.500
Successfully finding the body,

296
0:09:42.500 --> 0:09:44.210
Tobi steals the rinnegan for himself,

297
0:09:44.210 --> 0:09:46.180
and oh yeah Konan's dead.

298
0:09:46.180 --> 0:09:47.200
Rest in peace!

299
0:09:47.200 --> 0:09:49.630
Moving forward, Kabuto masters the reanimation jutsu.

300
0:09:49.630 --> 0:09:51.450
Using it, Kabuto reanimates Deidara

301
0:09:51.450 --> 0:09:52.470
and heads to Turtle Island.

302
0:09:52.470 --> 0:09:54.010
Capturing Yamato and using him

303
0:09:54.010 --> 0:09:55.710
to power up an army of white zetsus.

304
0:09:55.710 --> 0:09:57.470
With no time to waste, Kabuto releases the

305
0:09:57.470 --> 0:09:59.940
army of white zetsus as well as reanimated Shinobi.

306
0:09:59.940 --> 0:10:01.710
And all five great nations form an alliance

307
0:10:01.710 --> 0:10:03.510
creating the allied shinobi forces.

308
0:10:03.510 --> 0:10:04.640
With all that said and done,

309
0:10:04.640 --> 0:10:06.510
the fourth great ninja war begins.

310
0:10:06.510 --> 0:10:07.550
At this current point in time,

311
0:10:07.550 --> 0:10:08.790
Naruto starts getting suspicious

312
0:10:08.790 --> 0:10:10.460
because he's being confined on Turtle Island.

313
0:10:10.460 --> 0:10:11.590
He then barges through the guards

314
0:10:11.590 --> 0:10:13.000
and senses the war using sage mode.

315
0:10:13.000 --> 0:10:14.980
Both Naruto and Killer Bee then escapes Turtle Island,

316
0:10:14.980 --> 0:10:16.900
and heads to the battlefield, but are then intercepted

317
0:10:16.900 --> 0:10:18.300
by the Raikage and Tsunade.

318
0:10:18.300 --> 0:10:19.490
They manage to get through the two,

319
0:10:19.490 --> 0:10:20.740
but now face another challenge,

320
0:10:20.740 --> 0:10:23.640
which is to defeat Itachi and Nagato who were reanimated.

321
0:10:23.640 --> 0:10:26.500
Using the gift that Itachi gave to Naruto while back,

322
0:10:26.500 --> 0:10:28.330
Itachi regains control over his own body,

323
0:10:28.330 --> 0:10:29.852
undoing the edo tensei.

324
0:10:29.852 --> 0:10:31.790
Itachi then steals Nagato using totsuka blade

325
0:10:31.790 --> 0:10:33.830
and heads to Kabuto to stop the edo tensei.

326
0:10:33.830 --> 0:10:35.400
Moving forward, Madara is reanimated

327
0:10:35.400 --> 0:10:36.850
and makes his appearance on the battlefield.

328
0:10:36.850 --> 0:10:38.940
Pretty much spreading everyone's cheeks

329
0:10:38.940 --> 0:10:40.760
and even dropping a fucking meteor on them.

330
0:10:40.760 --> 0:10:42.270
Fighting together to stop Madara,

331
0:10:42.270 --> 0:10:44.110
the five hokage struggle to keep up with his power.

332
0:10:44.110 --> 0:10:45.320
Meanwhile, while that's going on,

333
0:10:45.320 --> 0:10:47.460
Naruto and Killer Bee are fighting the reanimated Jinchuuriki

334
0:10:47.460 --> 0:10:49.460
(Oh shit where are the tissues I'm having a nose bleed.)

335
0:10:49.460 --> 0:10:51.600
The Jinchuuriki then go into their Tailed Beast mode,

336
0:10:51.600 --> 0:10:53.200
and as a result of the situation,

337
0:10:53.200 --> 0:10:55.020
Naruto befriends Kurama obtaining bijuu mode.

338
0:10:55.020 --> 0:10:57.350
Moving forward, Sasuke recovers from his eye implants

339
0:10:57.350 --> 0:10:58.390
and heads to the Hidden Leaf.

340
0:10:58.390 --> 0:11:00.030
On his way there, Sasuke sees Itachi

341
0:11:00.030 --> 0:11:01.760
and follows him all the way to Kabuto's hideout.

342
0:11:01.760 --> 0:11:04.010
They then team up and defeat Kabuto using izanami.

343
0:11:04.010 --> 0:11:06.550
Using genjutsu, Itachi commands Kabuto to do the

344
0:11:06.550 --> 0:11:08.150
hand signs to release the edo tensei.

345
0:11:08.150 --> 0:11:11.100
With that said, Itachi says his farewell to Sasuke.

346
0:11:11.100 --> 0:11:12.680
The only person who remained from the edo tensei

347
0:11:12.680 --> 0:11:14.757
is Madara, because if you really think about it,

348
0:11:14.757 --> 0:11:16.200
he's fucking Madara.

349
0:11:16.200 --> 0:11:17.740
Moments after releasing the edo tensei,

350
0:11:17.740 --> 0:11:18.940
Jugo and Suigetsu arrive.

351
0:11:18.940 --> 0:11:20.560
Sasuke then uses Jugo's sage chakra,

352
0:11:20.560 --> 0:11:22.580
and Anko's curse mark to resurrect Orichimaru.

353
0:11:22.580 --> 0:11:24.610
Moving forward, Naruto is now going up against Tobi.

354
0:11:24.610 --> 0:11:26.980
Using a rasegan, Naruto bashes that mask

355
0:11:26.980 --> 0:11:28.560
revealing Tobi's true identity.

356
0:11:28.560 --> 0:11:30.070
Apparently he's Obito Uchiha,

357
0:11:30.070 --> 0:11:32.000
one of Kakashi's childhood comrads,

358
0:11:32.000 --> 0:11:34.242
or the guy who lost his shit after seeing

359
0:11:34.242 --> 0:11:35.080
(loud fighting strike)

360
0:11:35.080 --> 0:11:36.370
Shortly after Madara appears after

361
0:11:36.370 --> 0:11:38.270
demolishing the five hokage, as expected,

362
0:11:38.270 --> 0:11:39.650
and works side by side with Obito

363
0:11:39.650 --> 0:11:45.680
successfully summoning the ten tails.

364
0:11:45.680 --> 0:11:46.800
*thud*

365
0:11:46.800 --> 0:11:47.960
Rest in peace!

366
0:11:47.960 --> 0:11:49.587
Moving forward, with the help of Orochimaru,

367
0:11:49.587 --> 0:11:51.340
the former hokage reanimated,

368
0:11:51.340 --> 0:11:52.980
Sasuke decides to protect the Hidden Leaf

369
0:11:52.980 --> 0:11:55.230
and heads to the battlefield along with the former hokage.

370
0:11:55.230 --> 0:11:57.790
Team 7 is now reunited and Obito and Kakashi are

371
0:11:57.790 --> 0:12:00.790
in the Kamui's dimension settling their EPIC battle.

372
0:12:00.790 --> 0:12:02.500
After losing the fight, Obito teleports

373
0:12:02.500 --> 0:12:04.480
back to the battlefield then merges with the ten tails

374
0:12:04.480 --> 0:12:06.190
becoming the ten tails Jinchuuriki.

375
0:12:06.190 --> 0:12:08.710
Obito then uses the ten tails to spawn the divine tree,

376
0:12:08.710 --> 0:12:11.063
and moments after he's defeated by Naruto and Sasuke

377
0:12:11.063 --> 0:12:12.180
and extracted from his tailed beast.

378
0:12:12.180 --> 0:12:14.240
Upon defeating Obito, Naruto then gives one of his

379
0:12:14.240 --> 0:12:16.890
POWERFUL speeches transforming Obito

380
0:12:16.890 --> 0:12:19.340
into a good guy as corny as that sounds.

381
0:12:19.340 --> 0:12:21.670
As a result, Obito attempts to use the rinne rebirth

382
0:12:21.670 --> 0:12:23.360
to revive the casualties of the war,

383
0:12:23.360 --> 0:12:25.410
but is then soon after stopped by a black zetsu.

384
0:12:25.410 --> 0:12:27.380
Under black zetsu's control, the rinne rebirth

385
0:12:27.380 --> 0:12:28.720
is then used to Madara.

386
0:12:28.720 --> 0:12:30.367
Madara is then given a rinnegan by white zetsu,

387
0:12:30.367 --> 0:12:32.490
and uses it to summon the Gedo Statue,

388
0:12:32.490 --> 0:12:34.330
and absorbs every tailed beast.

389
0:12:34.330 --> 0:12:36.720
Upon completion he then merges with the Gedo Statue,

390
0:12:36.720 --> 0:12:38.650
becoming the ten tailed Jinjuuriki.

391
0:12:38.650 --> 0:12:42.200
Oh yeah and I forgot to mention,

392
0:12:42.200 --> 0:12:43.020
(heartbeat)

393
0:12:43.020 --> 0:12:46.620
Rest in peace!

394
0:12:46.620 --> 0:12:47.700
(metal blade slashing)

395
0:12:47.700 --> 0:12:48.520
Rest in peace!

396
0:12:48.520 --> 0:12:50.100
Oh wait, this isn't Akame ga Kill

397
0:12:50.100 --> 0:12:51.170
They actually end up surviving,

398
0:12:51.170 --> 0:12:52.290
and on top of that, they end up getting

399
0:12:52.290 --> 0:12:54.320
a power buff by the Sage of Six Paths.

400
0:12:54.320 --> 0:13:00.840
*Weeb cover of Naruto Shippuden OP16*

401
0:13:00.840 --> 0:13:02.460
Guy in the background: Yo the fuck you doing.

402
0:13:02.460 --> 0:13:06.460
Moe: I was just over here singing, yo yo CHILL

403
0:13:06.460 --> 0:13:07.460
PUT AWAY THE BELT!

404
0:13:07.460 --> 0:13:08.500
(slapping noises)

405
0:13:08.500 --> 0:13:10.160
Guy in the background: Don't you ever sing at night.

406
0:13:10.160 --> 0:13:12.840
Moving forward, Guy's looking like a burnt marshmallow

407
0:13:12.840 --> 0:13:13.850
after using the eight gates against Madara.

408
0:13:13.850 --> 0:13:16.117
Madara then goes out to Kakashi for his sharingan

409
0:13:16.117 --> 0:13:18.550
and uses it to travel to the Kimui's dimension.

410
0:13:18.550 --> 0:13:19.850
There he steals Obito's rinnegan

411
0:13:19.850 --> 0:13:22.000
because this bitch couldn't destroy it.

412
0:13:22.000 --> 0:13:23.280
Always fucking shit up.

413
0:13:23.280 --> 0:13:24.390
Now that he's acquired this,

414
0:13:24.390 --> 0:13:27.000
Madara now has all the requirements for Project Tsuki No Me,

415
0:13:27.000 --> 0:13:29.357
and executes the infinite Tsuki No Me.

416
0:13:29.357 --> 0:13:31.510
Thank you Uselessness, now everyone

417
0:13:31.510 --> 0:13:33.460
is sleep cause yo bitch ass.

418
0:13:33.460 --> 0:13:35.530
And now the only people who remain

419
0:13:35.530 --> 0:13:40.060
to stop the infinate Tsuki No Me is the OG Team 7.

420
0:13:40.060 --> 0:13:43.139
But little did we know Black Zetsu backstabs Madara.

421
0:13:43.139 --> 0:13:46.260
Get it, cause Black Zetsu stabbed

422
0:13:46.260 --> 0:13:48.640
his arm through Madara's back.

423
0:13:48.640 --> 0:13:51.000
(Get yo ugly ass out of here.)

424
0:13:51.000 --> 0:13:52.490
Black Zetsu then absorbs Madara,

425
0:13:52.490 --> 0:13:55.820
and the chakra from the divine tree to resurrect Kaguya.

426
0:13:55.820 --> 0:13:58.840
AKA the mother of all chakra.

427
0:13:58.840 --> 0:14:00.280
Apparently this was Black Zetsu's plan

428
0:14:00.280 --> 0:14:02.300
from the very beginning, so Team 7

429
0:14:02.300 --> 0:14:05.380
fights the final boss and successfully defeats

430
0:14:05.380 --> 0:14:09.180
and seals away Kaguya, and oh yeah,

431
0:14:09.180 --> 0:14:10.490
Obito dies in the process.

432
0:14:10.490 --> 0:14:11.470
Rest in peace!

433
0:14:11.470 --> 0:14:13.150
All that's left is for Naruto and Sasuke

434
0:14:13.150 --> 0:14:14.470
to undo the infinite Tsuki No Me.

435
0:14:14.470 --> 0:14:17.000
By simultaneously doing the rat hand sign,

436
0:14:17.000 --> 0:14:18.813
but Sasuke is then all like nah bitch.

437
0:14:18.813 --> 0:14:21.900
What the Shinobi world needs is REVOLUTION.

438
0:14:21.900 --> 0:14:23.510
With that said, both Naruto and Sasuke

439
0:14:23.510 --> 0:14:25.990
head to the final valley to settle their final battle.

440
0:14:25.990 --> 0:14:27.220
They then end their battle with their

441
0:14:27.220 --> 0:14:29.230
signature rasengan and chidori clash,

442
0:14:29.230 --> 0:14:31.340
resulting in both of them losing their dominant arm.

443
0:14:31.340 --> 0:14:34.000
Naruto then gives one of his POWERFUL speeches,

444
0:14:34.000 --> 0:14:37.500
AKA talk no jutsu, eliminating Sasuke's bad intension,

445
0:14:37.500 --> 0:14:39.950
and so they do the rat hand sign,

446
0:14:39.950 --> 0:14:41.400
releasing the infinite Tsuki No Me.

447
0:14:41.400 --> 0:14:43.857
Returning to civilization, Kakashi is assigned hokage,

448
0:14:43.857 --> 0:14:45.570
and Sasuke's in prison for the multiple

449
0:14:45.570 --> 0:14:46.710
crimes he's accountable for.

450
0:14:46.710 --> 0:14:49.100
Sasuke is then pardoned because of his contributions

451
0:14:49.100 --> 0:14:50.330
stopping the infinite Tsuki No Me,

452
0:14:50.330 --> 0:14:52.060
and also because Kakashi's the hokage.

453
0:14:52.060 --> 0:14:54.270
With that said, Sasuke then leaves the Hidden Leaf,

454
0:14:54.270 --> 0:14:56.590
to go on a journey to repent for his sins.

455
0:14:56.590 --> 0:14:58.920
But before doing so, Naruto gives him a parting gift

456
0:14:58.920 --> 0:15:00.550
on his way out, which is his old

457
0:15:00.550 --> 0:15:02.850
Hidden Leaf edition, forehead protector.

458
0:15:02.850 --> 0:15:06.940
And so as time goes by Naruto and Hinata get married and...

459
0:15:06.940 --> 0:15:08.780
oh that's it.

460
0:15:08.780 --> 0:15:12.060
*Weeb cover of Naruto Shippuden ED40*

461
0:15:12.060 --> 0:15:13.200
(Belt whip)

462
0:15:13.200 --> 0:15:15.460
Guy in the background: You really out here thinking I'm playing games.

463
0:15:15.460 --> 0:15:17.160
Moe: But I was just singin—

464
0:15:17.160 --> 0:15:18.700
(Belt whip) Guy in the background: SHUT YO ASS UP!

465
0:15:18.700 --> 0:15:20.260
Alright, so thank you all for watching.

466
0:15:20.260 --> 0:15:21.810
First and foremost I'd like to give a shout out to

467
0:15:21.810 --> 0:15:23.680
James Brantley, Kirby Mars, and all my other

468
0:15:23.680 --> 0:15:25.180
sexy ass Patreon supporters for

469
0:15:25.180 --> 0:15:26.460
supporting this channel through Patreon.

470
0:15:26.460 --> 0:15:27.760
It helps a ton when it comes to

471
0:15:27.760 --> 0:15:28.860
these anime in minutes by the way.

472
0:15:28.860 --> 0:15:30.320
So if you do support my anime in minutes,

473
0:15:30.320 --> 0:15:31.560
by supporting me on Patreon that

474
0:15:31.560 --> 0:15:33.140
actually helps a lot with the production

475
0:15:33.140 --> 0:15:34.460
of these anime in minutes, allowing me to produce them

476
0:15:34.460 --> 0:15:36.500
at a more frequent rate, because if you didn't know,

477
0:15:36.500 --> 0:15:38.020
it takes a lot of god damn time.

478
0:15:38.020 --> 0:15:40.140
But anyways, I did feel the need to remaster

479
0:15:40.140 --> 0:15:41.730
my Naruto Shipudden in minutes because,

480
0:15:41.730 --> 0:15:44.170
the audio quality was trash, and I feel like

481
0:15:44.170 --> 0:15:45.140
the scripts could have been better.

482
0:15:45.140 --> 0:15:47.130
And on top of that, I just had a lot of cringy ass parts,

483
0:15:47.130 --> 0:15:49.030
simply because that was just an experiment video

484
0:15:49.030 --> 0:15:51.580
believe or not, and it turned out to be my most viewed video

485
0:15:51.580 --> 0:15:52.980
which is absolutely fucked.

486
0:15:52.980 --> 0:15:54.900
But anyways once again thank you all for watching,

487
0:15:54.900 --> 0:15:57.362
and I will see you guys next time.

488
0:15:57.362 --> 0:15:59.362
Peace.
