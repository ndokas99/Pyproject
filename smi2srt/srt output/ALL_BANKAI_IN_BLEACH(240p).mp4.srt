1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:01.469
hey everybody talking one-on-one here in

2
0:00:01.469 --> 0:00:03.120
this video is every single bankai in the

3
0:00:03.120 --> 0:00:05.040
belief series who does it and a fun fact

4
0:00:05.040 --> 0:00:07.470
about it alright ready let's go this is

5
0:00:07.470 --> 0:00:09.150
the tensa zangetsu umbrella why do I

6
0:00:09.150 --> 0:00:11.219
have this cuz it's awesome first

7
0:00:11.219 --> 0:00:13.500
division the former head captain of the

8
0:00:13.500 --> 0:00:16.049
gotei 13 sheera Ketchikan Ryu sy

9
0:00:16.049 --> 0:00:19.020
Yamamoto his bankai is Zanka no tachi it

10
0:00:19.020 --> 0:00:21.029
is arguably the strongest bankai in the

11
0:00:21.029 --> 0:00:23.039
entire series as Yamamoto himself is

12
0:00:23.039 --> 0:00:25.170
over 1,000 years old it is broken into

13
0:00:25.170 --> 0:00:27.359
four different parts sonken Itachi east

14
0:00:27.359 --> 0:00:29.429
west south and north it's not good on

15
0:00:29.429 --> 0:00:31.199
tachi east compresses all the flames

16
0:00:31.199 --> 0:00:32.578
from his shikai down to a single

17
0:00:32.578 --> 0:00:33.420
longsword

18
0:00:33.420 --> 0:00:35.010
anything that he cuts with his sword is

19
0:00:35.010 --> 0:00:37.050
immediately incinerated out of existence

20
0:00:37.050 --> 0:00:39.390
Zanka no tachi west compresses all the

21
0:00:39.390 --> 0:00:41.160
flames around him making his body

22
0:00:41.160 --> 0:00:42.660
temperature increased to over one

23
0:00:42.660 --> 0:00:44.180
hundred and fifteen million degrees

24
0:00:44.180 --> 0:00:45.930
Fahrenheit that's hotter than the

25
0:00:45.930 --> 0:00:47.730
surface of the Sun nobody can even get

26
0:00:47.730 --> 0:00:49.050
close to him while he has long gone

27
0:00:49.050 --> 0:00:50.940
Itachi West activated as for Zanka no

28
0:00:50.940 --> 0:00:52.590
tachi south it is arguably the most

29
0:00:52.590 --> 0:00:54.239
badass technique in all of Bleach

30
0:00:54.239 --> 0:00:56.550
Yamamoto rises the dead

31
0:00:56.550 --> 0:00:58.710
the former enemies everybody he's slayed

32
0:00:58.710 --> 0:01:00.629
by his swords in over the thousand years

33
0:01:00.629 --> 0:01:02.430
in existence and they come back as

34
0:01:02.430 --> 0:01:04.890
burning charred skeletons that are

35
0:01:04.890 --> 0:01:06.600
basically his puppets he can control

36
0:01:06.600 --> 0:01:08.549
them as he would his regular sword and

37
0:01:08.549 --> 0:01:10.439
then finally Zanka no tachi north is

38
0:01:10.439 --> 0:01:12.900
basically just a massive fuck off attack

39
0:01:12.900 --> 0:01:14.729
that just incinerates everything more

40
0:01:14.729 --> 0:01:17.610
than Zanka no tachi Ystad yeah a fun

41
0:01:17.610 --> 0:01:19.320
fact about Yama's bankai is that it is

42
0:01:19.320 --> 0:01:20.970
now in the possession a you ha bark

43
0:01:20.970 --> 0:01:22.920
although he hasn't used it yet and some

44
0:01:22.920 --> 0:01:24.600
people are wondering if he ever is going

45
0:01:24.600 --> 0:01:26.610
to but moving on the former lieutenant

46
0:01:26.610 --> 0:01:28.799
of the first division Choji no Sasaki

47
0:01:28.799 --> 0:01:31.049
Bey's bankai is Tokyo gonorrheal Riku

48
0:01:31.049 --> 0:01:32.909
it's lightning based it summons a

49
0:01:32.909 --> 0:01:34.619
massive lightning dome behind him with

50
0:01:34.619 --> 0:01:36.030
lightning bolts striking out of it and

51
0:01:36.030 --> 0:01:37.799
he can basically just freely manipulate

52
0:01:37.799 --> 0:01:39.509
and strike up wherever he wants with the

53
0:01:39.509 --> 0:01:41.100
lightning bolt however he's never been

54
0:01:41.100 --> 0:01:42.630
shown actually using it because it was

55
0:01:42.630 --> 0:01:44.549
stolen by Driscoll Bercy and it was used

56
0:01:44.549 --> 0:01:46.770
on Yamamoto a fun fact about this is

57
0:01:46.770 --> 0:01:48.180
that he's never actually used it in

58
0:01:48.180 --> 0:01:49.770
battle before even though he's mastered

59
0:01:49.770 --> 0:01:51.840
it - please Yamamoto and when Yamamoto

60
0:01:51.840 --> 0:01:54.390
was attacked by a by Driscoll he stated

61
0:01:54.390 --> 0:01:56.189
that the bankai that shojiro had was not

62
0:01:56.189 --> 0:01:58.829
this week so arguably when shojiro was

63
0:01:58.829 --> 0:02:00.810
using it properly it was a lot stronger

64
0:02:00.810 --> 0:02:02.880
now the current captain commander of the

65
0:02:02.880 --> 0:02:04.710
gotei 13 and former captain of the 8th

66
0:02:04.710 --> 0:02:06.810
division students week yaku's bankai is

67
0:02:06.810 --> 0:02:10.050
conten kyokotsu Korematsu Shinju it's

68
0:02:10.050 --> 0:02:11.150
able to manipulate

69
0:02:11.150 --> 0:02:12.980
the entire battlefield converting it

70
0:02:12.980 --> 0:02:15.110
into stages of a play referred to as

71
0:02:15.110 --> 0:02:17.090
Dawn's depending on which dawn that

72
0:02:17.090 --> 0:02:18.470
students we is in the entire battlefield

73
0:02:18.470 --> 0:02:20.390
warps this is not an illusion this is

74
0:02:20.390 --> 0:02:22.220
not just mentioning messing with the

75
0:02:22.220 --> 0:02:23.780
person's mind this is physically

76
0:02:23.780 --> 0:02:25.430
changing the area around to suit his

77
0:02:25.430 --> 0:02:27.769
needs the first dawn conflict' all the

78
0:02:27.769 --> 0:02:29.510
injuries that you should sui has endured

79
0:02:29.510 --> 0:02:31.340
on to his opponent the second dawn

80
0:02:31.340 --> 0:02:33.319
causes a disease to spread on the

81
0:02:33.319 --> 0:02:34.159
opponent's body

82
0:02:34.159 --> 0:02:35.959
the third dawn summons in a massive

83
0:02:35.959 --> 0:02:38.060
underwater area where they'll both drown

84
0:02:38.060 --> 0:02:39.920
and the fourth dawn causes the

85
0:02:39.920 --> 0:02:41.450
opponent's head to be sliced off and

86
0:02:41.450 --> 0:02:43.700
then subsequently blown up by a thread

87
0:02:43.700 --> 0:02:45.709
that he has fun fact about this is that

88
0:02:45.709 --> 0:02:47.989
his bankai also summons is a zanpakuto

89
0:02:47.989 --> 0:02:50.209
spirit and kyokotsu behind it which

90
0:02:50.209 --> 0:02:53.000
takes the form of two women now this is

91
0:02:53.000 --> 0:02:54.440
indicating as soon suiza

92
0:02:54.440 --> 0:02:56.390
relationship with his zanpakuto is a

93
0:02:56.390 --> 0:02:59.450
little bit more intimate and romantic if

94
0:02:59.450 --> 0:03:00.409
you know what I mean

95
0:03:00.409 --> 0:03:02.870
second division captain SOI fons bankai

96
0:03:02.870 --> 0:03:04.909
chuckle all right Obon is a massive fuck

97
0:03:04.909 --> 0:03:08.450
off missile yeah I mean I hate her

98
0:03:08.450 --> 0:03:10.430
character but damn that's cool her

99
0:03:10.430 --> 0:03:12.019
bankai basically converts it into a

100
0:03:12.019 --> 0:03:13.579
giant really heavy missile on her arm

101
0:03:13.579 --> 0:03:15.739
although SOI fon hates to use it because

102
0:03:15.739 --> 0:03:17.359
it basically goes against her pride as

103
0:03:17.359 --> 0:03:19.250
the captain of the assassination corpse

104
0:03:19.250 --> 0:03:21.109
it's way too big to move and it's way

105
0:03:21.109 --> 0:03:22.669
too flashy - you know assassinate

106
0:03:22.669 --> 0:03:24.560
somebody from a distance but man is it

107
0:03:24.560 --> 0:03:26.450
cool fun fact is she can only use it

108
0:03:26.450 --> 0:03:28.549
once every three days she can you know

109
0:03:28.549 --> 0:03:30.019
use it more than that but it taxes her

110
0:03:30.019 --> 0:03:31.519
considerably which just makes it be

111
0:03:31.519 --> 0:03:32.989
known that SOI phone has quite the

112
0:03:32.989 --> 0:03:34.549
considerable amount of stamina their

113
0:03:34.549 --> 0:03:37.040
third division ex captain Guinea -

114
0:03:37.040 --> 0:03:39.769
maru's bankai , she Nino yari basically

115
0:03:39.769 --> 0:03:41.419
just extends the shikai ability whereas

116
0:03:41.419 --> 0:03:43.639
the Shi Kai could extend the sword 100

117
0:03:43.639 --> 0:03:45.680
swords length the bankai can extend it

118
0:03:45.680 --> 0:03:47.359
indefinitely we don't actually know how

119
0:03:47.359 --> 0:03:49.639
far it can extend GG instead it was

120
0:03:49.639 --> 0:03:51.169
about 13 kilometers but that was

121
0:03:51.169 --> 0:03:52.519
revealed to later be a lie and he also

122
0:03:52.519 --> 0:03:54.889
said they can travel really fast beyond

123
0:03:54.889 --> 0:03:56.120
the speed of sound but that was also

124
0:03:56.120 --> 0:03:57.650
revealed to be alive the only thing we

125
0:03:57.650 --> 0:03:59.150
know for certain is it's really fucking

126
0:03:59.150 --> 0:04:00.980
long and it's really fucking fast the

127
0:04:00.980 --> 0:04:02.569
true ability of his bankai though is

128
0:04:02.569 --> 0:04:04.340
whenever it's extending and contracting

129
0:04:04.340 --> 0:04:05.900
he can leave a little sliver of the

130
0:04:05.900 --> 0:04:07.639
blade inside of the person and then he

131
0:04:07.639 --> 0:04:09.349
can activate the true bankai ability

132
0:04:09.349 --> 0:04:11.720
kill commission no yari which allows

133
0:04:11.720 --> 0:04:13.760
heavy whatever area is being afflicted

134
0:04:13.760 --> 0:04:15.109
by the sword to be disintegrated on a

135
0:04:15.109 --> 0:04:18.229
cellular level a fun fact about this is

136
0:04:18.229 --> 0:04:20.000
that he attempted to use this against

137
0:04:20.000 --> 0:04:22.640
Aizen but it didn't really work not

138
0:04:22.640 --> 0:04:24.440
really a fun fact cuz he died but that's

139
0:04:24.440 --> 0:04:24.750
all

140
0:04:24.750 --> 0:04:26.730
got another former captain of the 3rd

141
0:04:26.730 --> 0:04:28.200
division and somebody you probably don't

142
0:04:28.200 --> 0:04:30.030
even remember cuz it was any anime only

143
0:04:30.030 --> 0:04:33.060
arc is shusuke amagai and his bankai was

144
0:04:33.060 --> 0:04:35.240
hold on I have to read this here um

145
0:04:35.240 --> 0:04:38.280
right get going Kaku yeah no one

146
0:04:38.280 --> 0:04:39.000
remembers this

147
0:04:39.000 --> 0:04:40.790
it's a giant seashell that spits fire

148
0:04:40.790 --> 0:04:43.770
that's that's pretty much it the current

149
0:04:43.770 --> 0:04:45.540
captain of the 3rd division if he's not

150
0:04:45.540 --> 0:04:47.790
dead which he might possibly be Roger Oh

151
0:04:47.790 --> 0:04:50.310
Otonashi or just rose is king shahdov

152
0:04:50.310 --> 0:04:52.470
butoden it summons an entire dance

153
0:04:52.470 --> 0:04:54.030
troupe that's able to being manipulated

154
0:04:54.030 --> 0:04:57.120
by roses conductors one basically his

155
0:04:57.120 --> 0:04:59.580
bankai takes the form of a concert of

156
0:04:59.580 --> 0:05:00.990
the different stages of a concert

157
0:05:00.990 --> 0:05:02.550
similar to shewn squeeze which was a

158
0:05:02.550 --> 0:05:04.680
play the first act of the plane we don't

159
0:05:04.680 --> 0:05:05.940
know if this is the only things he can

160
0:05:05.940 --> 0:05:07.530
do with his bankai possibly he can do a

161
0:05:07.530 --> 0:05:09.180
lot more with it but the ones that we

162
0:05:09.180 --> 0:05:11.970
saw were the following act one Seadrift

163
0:05:11.970 --> 0:05:13.800
manipulating sound to make it seem like

164
0:05:13.800 --> 0:05:15.870
an entire whirlpools around the opponent

165
0:05:15.870 --> 0:05:18.270
act 2 Prometheus using the same sound

166
0:05:18.270 --> 0:05:19.740
based abilities he's able to summon

167
0:05:19.740 --> 0:05:21.690
shine fireballs to burn the opponent and

168
0:05:21.690 --> 0:05:24.930
finally act 3 um the hero's journey was

169
0:05:24.930 --> 0:05:26.940
never seen because he was kind of killed

170
0:05:26.940 --> 0:05:29.430
by massed a mass Julian before he had a

171
0:05:29.430 --> 0:05:31.470
chance to but once again we don't really

172
0:05:31.470 --> 0:05:32.610
know his bankai

173
0:05:32.610 --> 0:05:34.560
could do more than that fun fact is that

174
0:05:34.560 --> 0:05:36.270
he's actually manipulating his opponents

175
0:05:36.270 --> 0:05:38.370
a sense of sound so even though it looks

176
0:05:38.370 --> 0:05:40.440
like fire and water it's not really that

177
0:05:40.440 --> 0:05:42.000
it's just that the opponent is being

178
0:05:42.000 --> 0:05:43.440
manipulated to the point that he feels

179
0:05:43.440 --> 0:05:45.419
that he's being attacked by water or by

180
0:05:45.419 --> 0:05:46.140
fire

181
0:05:46.140 --> 0:05:48.270
former 4th division captain Rhett Seward

182
0:05:48.270 --> 0:05:50.070
shooter who Nahanni the first kampachi

183
0:05:50.070 --> 0:05:53.370
spawn kai is mean uzuki and we honestly

184
0:05:53.370 --> 0:05:55.050
don't know really what this can do some

185
0:05:55.050 --> 0:05:56.729
people say it's blood some people say

186
0:05:56.729 --> 0:05:59.700
it's acid but yeah just summons a bunch

187
0:05:59.700 --> 0:06:01.440
of goop behind her and she was killed by

188
0:06:01.440 --> 0:06:03.060
Kenpachi before we actually got to see

189
0:06:03.060 --> 0:06:05.700
what it could truly do um but it is kind

190
0:06:05.700 --> 0:06:07.860
of freaky um fun fact about it is that

191
0:06:07.860 --> 0:06:09.840
her shikai and bankai actually say uh

192
0:06:09.840 --> 0:06:12.419
share the same name on mean uzuki it's

193
0:06:12.419 --> 0:06:15.330
just a different translation for each

194
0:06:15.330 --> 0:06:17.310
one can we move on please this is really

195
0:06:17.310 --> 0:06:19.380
getting uncomfortable 6 division captain

196
0:06:19.380 --> 0:06:21.690
byakuya kuchiki bankai is senbonzakura

197
0:06:21.690 --> 0:06:22.650
kageyoshi

198
0:06:22.650 --> 0:06:25.440
it can also extend the aspects of his

199
0:06:25.440 --> 0:06:26.910
shikai whereas the shikai can only

200
0:06:26.910 --> 0:06:29.040
create 1000 flower petals this has

201
0:06:29.040 --> 0:06:31.020
multiplied over to hundreds of millions

202
0:06:31.020 --> 0:06:33.570
in senbonzakura kageyoshi he can also

203
0:06:33.570 --> 0:06:35.610
redirect the the petals using his hands

204
0:06:35.610 --> 0:06:37.139
making them twice as fast and

205
0:06:37.139 --> 0:06:38.639
a variety of techniques he can create

206
0:06:38.639 --> 0:06:41.340
using these flower petals sink' the

207
0:06:41.340 --> 0:06:42.840
massacre scene compresses all the

208
0:06:42.840 --> 0:06:44.280
individual flower petals down into an

209
0:06:44.280 --> 0:06:45.629
array of blades that he can summon

210
0:06:45.629 --> 0:06:48.060
whenever he desires go Kay creates an

211
0:06:48.060 --> 0:06:50.460
entire sphere of the swirling mass of

212
0:06:50.460 --> 0:06:51.930
razor blades that he can compress on the

213
0:06:51.930 --> 0:06:53.430
opponent killing them immediately and

214
0:06:53.430 --> 0:06:55.080
then his final finishing move

215
0:06:55.080 --> 0:06:57.270
Shu K Haku taken compresses all the

216
0:06:57.270 --> 0:06:58.740
flower petals down to a single blade

217
0:06:58.740 --> 0:07:01.229
with a Kip hair of kick-ass angel wings

218
0:07:01.229 --> 0:07:04.229
for one final attack fun fact is it may

219
0:07:04.229 --> 0:07:06.029
or may not have gone stronger ever since

220
0:07:06.029 --> 0:07:07.379
he's been training at the soul house so

221
0:07:07.379 --> 0:07:08.550
we're just gonna have to wait and see

222
0:07:08.550 --> 0:07:11.129
the lieutenant of the six division Renji

223
0:07:11.129 --> 0:07:13.110
a bar I actually has two forms of his

224
0:07:13.110 --> 0:07:14.879
bankai the first form that were made

225
0:07:14.879 --> 0:07:17.069
aware of his he he owes aa BIMARU which

226
0:07:17.069 --> 0:07:19.620
creates a massive snake attachment that

227
0:07:19.620 --> 0:07:21.479
he controls kind of like a whip his

228
0:07:21.479 --> 0:07:23.610
special technique in this form was he

229
0:07:23.610 --> 0:07:24.990
cuts through tae-ho which basically just

230
0:07:24.990 --> 0:07:26.939
compresses all of his reiatsu together

231
0:07:26.939 --> 0:07:29.069
into one big attack he can also separate

232
0:07:29.069 --> 0:07:31.439
the joints in order to dispel certain

233
0:07:31.439 --> 0:07:33.150
attacks from the opponent however this

234
0:07:33.150 --> 0:07:34.949
was later revealed only to be half of

235
0:07:34.949 --> 0:07:37.229
his bankai as full potential by each

236
0:07:37.229 --> 0:07:39.089
ebay heosu Bey who revealed that his

237
0:07:39.089 --> 0:07:40.800
zanpakuto is not really lying to him

238
0:07:40.800 --> 0:07:42.449
just kind of you know holding back the

239
0:07:42.449 --> 0:07:44.159
true power until he was ready but after

240
0:07:44.159 --> 0:07:46.020
he did become ready after he trained at

241
0:07:46.020 --> 0:07:47.669
the soul house Ichi Bay told him the

242
0:07:47.669 --> 0:07:50.099
true name of his bankai Soul zombie Maru

243
0:07:50.099 --> 0:07:52.169
taking full advantage of both the snake

244
0:07:52.169 --> 0:07:54.389
and the baboon aspect now he can control

245
0:07:54.389 --> 0:07:56.849
an entire Pabu arm on his left side so

246
0:07:56.849 --> 0:07:59.069
you know event rate increasing punching

247
0:07:59.069 --> 0:08:01.020
power and then the sword on his right

248
0:08:01.020 --> 0:08:02.520
side can be freely manipulated in

249
0:08:02.520 --> 0:08:04.529
different shapes and forms relating a

250
0:08:04.529 --> 0:08:06.689
new technique he owes a coup which is

251
0:08:06.689 --> 0:08:08.430
basically an attack that bites down the

252
0:08:08.430 --> 0:08:10.229
opponent using the snake aspect and I

253
0:08:10.229 --> 0:08:12.330
don't know burns them to a cinder as

254
0:08:12.330 --> 0:08:13.830
we've seen with masked a masculine it's

255
0:08:13.830 --> 0:08:15.659
a really cool bonk I hope we see it

256
0:08:15.659 --> 0:08:18.629
again later 7th division captain such

257
0:08:18.629 --> 0:08:20.759
income amorous bankai is kokujo tengen

258
0:08:20.759 --> 0:08:23.039
me all it creates a giant that is

259
0:08:23.039 --> 0:08:24.960
completely manipulated by comum or

260
0:08:24.960 --> 0:08:26.580
whatever movements he makes the giant

261
0:08:26.580 --> 0:08:28.379
makes a downside to this though is that

262
0:08:28.379 --> 0:08:30.419
every attack that the giant endures soda

263
0:08:30.419 --> 0:08:32.399
sahjhan however a reverse of this is

264
0:08:32.399 --> 0:08:34.260
that whenever sahjhan heals his bankai

265
0:08:34.260 --> 0:08:36.120
heals as well he is the only known

266
0:08:36.120 --> 0:08:38.370
bankai that is able to repair itself

267
0:08:38.370 --> 0:08:40.320
usually every other bankai if it gets

268
0:08:40.320 --> 0:08:41.909
damaged it's gone forever as we've seen

269
0:08:41.909 --> 0:08:44.339
with ichigo's tensa zangetsu fun fact

270
0:08:44.339 --> 0:08:46.079
about this is that after he mastered the

271
0:08:46.079 --> 0:08:47.680
humanization technique from his

272
0:08:47.680 --> 0:08:49.420
shit lost clan he was able to activate

273
0:08:49.420 --> 0:08:51.640
Coco choten get me all Don guy Joe

274
0:08:51.640 --> 0:08:53.560
shedding the armor so it's just a

275
0:08:53.560 --> 0:08:56.620
complete massive REO however now the co

276
0:08:56.620 --> 0:08:58.690
more has been turning to well a dog we

277
0:08:58.690 --> 0:09:00.160
don't really know if he's gonna be able

278
0:09:00.160 --> 0:09:01.750
to use bankai again or what form that

279
0:09:01.750 --> 0:09:03.730
would take just keep in mind at the

280
0:09:03.730 --> 0:09:04.870
moment there is nobody in the 8th

281
0:09:04.870 --> 0:09:06.550
division and those bankai because soon

282
0:09:06.550 --> 0:09:08.860
Sui was moved over to the first division

283
0:09:08.860 --> 0:09:10.959
so moving on to the 9th division we have

284
0:09:10.959 --> 0:09:13.060
the current captain who also probably is

285
0:09:13.060 --> 0:09:15.339
most likely dead kin say mu Karuma his

286
0:09:15.339 --> 0:09:18.130
bankai is Tekken touchy Kazi compressing

287
0:09:18.130 --> 0:09:20.350
his sword down to two gauntlets on his

288
0:09:20.350 --> 0:09:22.300
right and left arm as well as this giant

289
0:09:22.300 --> 0:09:23.740
stretchy thing that's behind him don't

290
0:09:23.740 --> 0:09:25.029
really know what's up with that but

291
0:09:25.029 --> 0:09:26.740
anyway he can control the shape of these

292
0:09:26.740 --> 0:09:28.899
gauntlets on his arm he's made them axe

293
0:09:28.899 --> 0:09:30.070
blades he's made them like brass

294
0:09:30.070 --> 0:09:32.020
knuckles before and every time he comes

295
0:09:32.020 --> 0:09:33.520
in contact with something as long as

296
0:09:33.520 --> 0:09:35.649
he's in contact with the blade touching

297
0:09:35.649 --> 0:09:37.750
the opponent as successive explosions

298
0:09:37.750 --> 0:09:39.279
will be set off basically nuking the

299
0:09:39.279 --> 0:09:42.130
opponent out of existence a interesting

300
0:09:42.130 --> 0:09:43.839
fun fact here with Ken say as he was the

301
0:09:43.839 --> 0:09:46.300
first visor to release his bankai now

302
0:09:46.300 --> 0:09:47.770
the former captain of the 9th division

303
0:09:47.770 --> 0:09:50.380
Kaname Tosen spawn Chi is suzumushi

304
0:09:50.380 --> 0:09:53.470
shush-shush key and makoto key whilst

305
0:09:53.470 --> 0:09:55.930
inside this black dome the senses of

306
0:09:55.930 --> 0:09:58.060
sight hearing and smell are removed from

307
0:09:58.060 --> 0:09:59.980
the opponent allowing Kaname to attack

308
0:09:59.980 --> 0:10:01.990
his will with his sealed zanpakuto

309
0:10:01.990 --> 0:10:03.700
however it doesn't take away the sense

310
0:10:03.700 --> 0:10:05.050
of touch which is a fun fact

311
0:10:05.050 --> 0:10:07.060
ah well fun fact for me not so much

312
0:10:07.060 --> 0:10:08.440
anybody that could figure out really

313
0:10:08.440 --> 0:10:10.270
quickly how his bankai works as did

314
0:10:10.270 --> 0:10:12.760
kampachi and he was eliminated also once

315
0:10:12.760 --> 0:10:14.320
he activated his Hall as I holla

316
0:10:14.320 --> 0:10:15.820
fication we don't really know if he can

317
0:10:15.820 --> 0:10:17.640
use bankai or if it would be different

318
0:10:17.640 --> 0:10:20.110
and we won't in the future because well

319
0:10:20.110 --> 0:10:22.240
he's dead 10th division captain toshiro

320
0:10:22.240 --> 0:10:24.700
hitsugaya Steiger and Yuri Maru it's one

321
0:10:24.700 --> 0:10:26.140
that's also just an extension of his

322
0:10:26.140 --> 0:10:28.330
shikai it creates massive ice swings as

323
0:10:28.330 --> 0:10:31.209
long as ice up and down his body ending

324
0:10:31.209 --> 0:10:33.100
in a sword he's able to use an array of

325
0:10:33.100 --> 0:10:34.810
icy techniques as long with the most

326
0:10:34.810 --> 0:10:36.100
basic and probably the most strongest

327
0:10:36.100 --> 0:10:38.320
technique of whether subjugation he's

328
0:10:38.320 --> 0:10:40.450
able to manipulate snow and rain and

329
0:10:40.450 --> 0:10:42.640
frost at will this will lead to his most

330
0:10:42.640 --> 0:10:44.800
strongest technique joltin caucus oh and

331
0:10:44.800 --> 0:10:46.899
a fun fact here is that his bankai is

332
0:10:46.899 --> 0:10:48.520
probably the least difference between

333
0:10:48.520 --> 0:10:51.100
the shikai and into the bankai state

334
0:10:51.100 --> 0:10:52.870
he's able to use technically any

335
0:10:52.870 --> 0:10:55.270
technique in his bankai in his shikai

336
0:10:55.270 --> 0:10:57.010
and vice versa it's just that when he

337
0:10:57.010 --> 0:10:58.720
ever uses the bigger techniques like ryu

338
0:10:58.720 --> 0:10:59.990
Senka and heal

339
0:10:59.990 --> 0:11:01.790
and Yaka so well and shikai it's just a

340
0:11:01.790 --> 0:11:04.250
lot more dangerous and also he might be

341
0:11:04.250 --> 0:11:05.810
kind of an experienced he's trying to

342
0:11:05.810 --> 0:11:07.250
train up to learn his bankai but we

343
0:11:07.250 --> 0:11:08.630
don't really know he's mastered it yet

344
0:11:08.630 --> 0:11:11.149
the ice flowers represent how long he

345
0:11:11.149 --> 0:11:13.010
has left in his bankai and I'm gonna

346
0:11:13.010 --> 0:11:14.690
assume that whatever the ice flowers are

347
0:11:14.690 --> 0:11:16.130
just gone and he's allowed to stay in

348
0:11:16.130 --> 0:11:18.290
his bankai indefinitely that's when he's

349
0:11:18.290 --> 0:11:19.970
truly mastered it and he hasn't reached

350
0:11:19.970 --> 0:11:22.010
that point yet so keep on training

351
0:11:22.010 --> 0:11:24.200
Toshiro or not I really don't care I

352
0:11:24.200 --> 0:11:26.270
don't really like to show that much 11th

353
0:11:26.270 --> 0:11:28.220
division captain Kenpachi Zaraki spawn

354
0:11:28.220 --> 0:11:30.500
Kai is unknown we don't know the name

355
0:11:30.500 --> 0:11:32.089
because it was just revealed in the last

356
0:11:32.089 --> 0:11:35.089
bleach chapter 669 it turns him into a

357
0:11:35.089 --> 0:11:38.390
ochre oni Kishin sort of deal it removes

358
0:11:38.390 --> 0:11:41.209
all sense of individuality or reason or

359
0:11:41.209 --> 0:11:42.800
speech rhyme and he just turns into a

360
0:11:42.800 --> 0:11:45.170
massive guts beserker lunatic attacking

361
0:11:45.170 --> 0:11:47.450
his opponent which a much more shrunken

362
0:11:47.450 --> 0:11:50.029
down form of nose Arashi fun fact about

363
0:11:50.029 --> 0:11:51.770
this is it's the only bankai in

364
0:11:51.770 --> 0:11:53.420
existence that operates in this way

365
0:11:53.420 --> 0:11:54.860
actually changing the person's

366
0:11:54.860 --> 0:11:57.170
personality that activates it we don't

367
0:11:57.170 --> 0:11:58.730
really know what's up with it yet we do

368
0:11:58.730 --> 0:12:00.200
know yet series involved a little bit

369
0:12:00.200 --> 0:12:01.940
who is most likely the true form of nose

370
0:12:01.940 --> 0:12:03.709
Arashi but as I said it was just

371
0:12:03.709 --> 0:12:05.420
revealed in the last chapter so we don't

372
0:12:05.420 --> 0:12:07.220
really know much about it yet the third

373
0:12:07.220 --> 0:12:08.990
seat of the 11th division II Kaku Madara

374
0:12:08.990 --> 0:12:12.200
Mays bankai is Ryu mo Hazuki Maru it

375
0:12:12.200 --> 0:12:13.910
takes the three segments from his shikai

376
0:12:13.910 --> 0:12:15.500
and makes them into basically just three

377
0:12:15.500 --> 0:12:18.050
massive fuck-off weapons two blades that

378
0:12:18.050 --> 0:12:20.029
he's holding as well as a giant uh I

379
0:12:20.029 --> 0:12:21.770
don't know what the Japanese name for

380
0:12:21.770 --> 0:12:23.329
that thing is you'll probably tell me in

381
0:12:23.329 --> 0:12:24.860
the comments but anyway yeah his bankai

382
0:12:24.860 --> 0:12:26.660
is essentially just a huge mass of power

383
0:12:26.660 --> 0:12:28.279
but that's not necessarily a good thing

384
0:12:28.279 --> 0:12:30.920
because it means that there's no speed

385
0:12:30.920 --> 0:12:32.899
and no defense just using it once in his

386
0:12:32.899 --> 0:12:34.640
fight against edaradi Lyonnaise arrancar

387
0:12:34.640 --> 0:12:36.440
number 13 he managed to damage it

388
0:12:36.440 --> 0:12:38.329
considerably and although Alcon was able

389
0:12:38.329 --> 0:12:39.320
to kind of piece it back together

390
0:12:39.320 --> 0:12:41.810
superficially as I stated once the

391
0:12:41.810 --> 0:12:42.709
bankai is broken

392
0:12:42.709 --> 0:12:44.329
there ain't no repairing that shit so

393
0:12:44.329 --> 0:12:46.220
REO Mon hazuki motto is not even close

394
0:12:46.220 --> 0:12:47.540
to being as strong as it originally was

395
0:12:47.540 --> 0:12:49.399
a fun fact is that he coffee was on

396
0:12:49.399 --> 0:12:51.200
Pocket Oh spirit hozukimaru is a kind of

397
0:12:51.200 --> 0:12:53.360
a lazy open takes a long-ass time waking

398
0:12:53.360 --> 0:12:55.760
up when you cock he goes into bankai you

399
0:12:55.760 --> 0:12:57.649
can keep the progress monitored on this

400
0:12:57.649 --> 0:12:59.390
on a blade and whenever that dragon is

401
0:12:59.390 --> 0:13:01.430
fully lit up in crimson red well you

402
0:13:01.430 --> 0:13:02.959
better watch out or ever you're fighting

403
0:13:02.959 --> 0:13:04.399
against because he cock who's about to

404
0:13:04.399 --> 0:13:06.050
bust out some good old-fashioned 11

405
0:13:06.050 --> 0:13:07.810
squad ass-whooping on ya

406
0:13:07.810 --> 0:13:10.570
yeah 12th division captain my Yuri could

407
0:13:10.570 --> 0:13:13.150
cinchy his bankai is konjiki ashisogi

408
0:13:13.150 --> 0:13:16.930
jizo creating a massive um I don't even

409
0:13:16.930 --> 0:13:18.279
know what this thing is it's a

410
0:13:18.279 --> 0:13:20.920
caterpillar baby bladed things whatever

411
0:13:20.920 --> 0:13:23.110
it shoots poison the poison can be

412
0:13:23.110 --> 0:13:25.600
modified by my Yuri at will it's made of

413
0:13:25.600 --> 0:13:27.070
his own blood so he's not affected by it

414
0:13:27.070 --> 0:13:28.810
neither is nemu his assistant captain

415
0:13:28.810 --> 0:13:31.120
and his bankai is probably the most

416
0:13:31.120 --> 0:13:32.589
versatile because him being a mad

417
0:13:32.589 --> 0:13:34.660
scientist he's rigged it to explode in

418
0:13:34.660 --> 0:13:36.220
case it's ever used against him and he

419
0:13:36.220 --> 0:13:37.990
used the demon womb raft and disease to

420
0:13:37.990 --> 0:13:40.360
further its evolution into a giant baby

421
0:13:40.360 --> 0:13:43.180
wearing a loin cloth um whatever attack

422
0:13:43.180 --> 0:13:45.190
or technique that the enemy uses against

423
0:13:45.190 --> 0:13:46.930
the demon wound wrapped in disease will

424
0:13:46.930 --> 0:13:48.730
be able to be simulated by it and then

425
0:13:48.730 --> 0:13:50.800
the giant baby will give birth to

426
0:13:50.800 --> 0:13:53.050
another giant baby by a c-section

427
0:13:53.050 --> 0:13:55.000
that is completely modified in immune to

428
0:13:55.000 --> 0:13:56.380
whatever technique it learned from the

429
0:13:56.380 --> 0:13:58.420
opponent okay can we move on I mean my

430
0:13:58.420 --> 0:13:59.950
yard is my favorite captain but man this

431
0:13:59.950 --> 0:14:02.020
is kind of disturbing yeah little bit

432
0:14:02.020 --> 0:14:04.360
the former captain of the 12th division

433
0:14:04.360 --> 0:14:05.980
and current awesome candy shop owner

434
0:14:05.980 --> 0:14:08.380
quisqueya Haris bankai is Kenan Brockie

435
0:14:08.380 --> 0:14:10.779
bene he may at arome i probably

436
0:14:10.779 --> 0:14:12.430
pronounced that wrong but whatever it

437
0:14:12.430 --> 0:14:14.320
summons a giant woman behind him and

438
0:14:14.320 --> 0:14:16.000
he's able to freely reconstruct and

439
0:14:16.000 --> 0:14:17.710
reconstitute whatever he desires with

440
0:14:17.710 --> 0:14:19.870
his bankai this includes our repairing

441
0:14:19.870 --> 0:14:21.250
his eyes that were completely destroyed

442
0:14:21.250 --> 0:14:24.040
by asking or remodel fiying his arm to

443
0:14:24.040 --> 0:14:25.960
make it more stronger or to basically

444
0:14:25.960 --> 0:14:28.330
allow other people in this certain field

445
0:14:28.330 --> 0:14:29.170
that was apparently

446
0:14:29.170 --> 0:14:31.120
inescapable by asking he was able to

447
0:14:31.120 --> 0:14:33.339
penetrate it all in all it's not really

448
0:14:33.339 --> 0:14:35.260
a bankai that's known for attacking it's

449
0:14:35.260 --> 0:14:37.480
more restructuring but the things you

450
0:14:37.480 --> 0:14:38.800
can do with it are possibly endless

451
0:14:38.800 --> 0:14:40.240
especially since you are Hara is a

452
0:14:40.240 --> 0:14:41.890
genius we didn't really get to see that

453
0:14:41.890 --> 0:14:44.380
much of it as with chem Pacis but it is

454
0:14:44.380 --> 0:14:46.600
pretty kick-ass fun fact about it is

455
0:14:46.600 --> 0:14:48.100
that he attained this bankai the same

456
0:14:48.100 --> 0:14:49.630
way that Ichigo did by using the

457
0:14:49.630 --> 0:14:51.100
three-day method with the 10-sheet eye

458
0:14:51.100 --> 0:14:53.770
it was kind of dangerous to do but it so

459
0:14:53.770 --> 0:14:55.209
hard we're talking about here so that

460
0:14:55.209 --> 0:14:57.430
guy pulled it off 13th division

461
0:14:57.430 --> 0:14:59.860
lieutenant Rukia Kuchiki and my favorite

462
0:14:59.860 --> 0:15:01.690
bleach characters bankai is Hakka no

463
0:15:01.690 --> 0:15:04.060
toga make it completely encases her in

464
0:15:04.060 --> 0:15:06.190
ice making her Chi like an ice statue

465
0:15:06.190 --> 0:15:07.779
which also kinda makes me question if

466
0:15:07.779 --> 0:15:09.550
she can even move while she's in this

467
0:15:09.550 --> 0:15:11.410
bankai and from what we've seen of it

468
0:15:11.410 --> 0:15:13.240
basically just sets off an atom bomb of

469
0:15:13.240 --> 0:15:14.980
cold around her anything that's even

470
0:15:14.980 --> 0:15:16.810
close to her gets frozen to the very

471
0:15:16.810 --> 0:15:19.030
bony core and just disintegrates into

472
0:15:19.030 --> 0:15:19.980
the wind

473
0:15:19.980 --> 0:15:21.390
we gonna say that her bankai is one of

474
0:15:21.390 --> 0:15:23.340
the very few her like a one-hit ko cuz

475
0:15:23.340 --> 0:15:24.600
like I said it doesn't look like she can

476
0:15:24.600 --> 0:15:26.280
really fight while in that state and

477
0:15:26.280 --> 0:15:29.220
even the act of releasing her bankai and

478
0:15:29.220 --> 0:15:30.870
going back to her shikai stage or her

479
0:15:30.870 --> 0:15:33.360
silva state it takes a lot of effort if

480
0:15:33.360 --> 0:15:34.920
you make one misstep you're screwed over

481
0:15:34.920 --> 0:15:36.720
so I'm gonna say it's the one-hit ko

482
0:15:36.720 --> 0:15:39.690
iced bankai and now finally those zero

483
0:15:39.690 --> 0:15:42.540
divisions captain each of a heosu be his

484
0:15:42.540 --> 0:15:45.900
bankai is ichimonji Sheriff Uday it's

485
0:15:45.900 --> 0:15:47.460
not really called a bankai though he

486
0:15:47.460 --> 0:15:49.020
refers it to us like the evolution of a

487
0:15:49.020 --> 0:15:51.600
zanpakuto because his is quite possibly

488
0:15:51.600 --> 0:15:53.460
the very first zanpakuto ever in

489
0:15:53.460 --> 0:15:56.220
creation I transforms his a black pan

490
0:15:56.220 --> 0:15:58.470
into a white pen and whenever he attacks

491
0:15:58.470 --> 0:16:00.870
with he's able to rename whatever he

492
0:16:00.870 --> 0:16:03.180
strikes so in his shikai he blots out

493
0:16:03.180 --> 0:16:05.280
whatever it is and then in his bankai he

494
0:16:05.280 --> 0:16:07.230
can rename it and whatever he renames it

495
0:16:07.230 --> 0:16:09.000
as will have the same qualities as that

496
0:16:09.000 --> 0:16:10.590
for example when he used it against you

497
0:16:10.590 --> 0:16:13.260
ah he renamed him black and so whatever

498
0:16:13.260 --> 0:16:15.300
abilities or power that you all had has

499
0:16:15.300 --> 0:16:17.250
now been reduced to just the power of a

500
0:16:17.250 --> 0:16:18.810
black hand which is like a feeble little

501
0:16:18.810 --> 0:16:20.670
insect that each EBA thought he could

502
0:16:20.670 --> 0:16:22.740
just smash with his hands of course you

503
0:16:22.740 --> 0:16:24.390
are as freaking you high and that didn't

504
0:16:24.390 --> 0:16:26.280
really go out too well but there you go

505
0:16:26.280 --> 0:16:28.020
ladies and gentlemen that's every

506
0:16:28.020 --> 0:16:30.390
fucking bankai and bleach god my mouth

507
0:16:30.390 --> 0:16:32.310
is ah I mean I gotta go get a drink

508
0:16:32.310 --> 0:16:34.650
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed I think I

509
0:16:34.650 --> 0:16:36.840
got them all I think pretty sure I know

510
0:16:36.840 --> 0:16:38.670
someone's gonna comment like you forgot

511
0:16:38.670 --> 0:16:40.170
about this trivial character that nobody

512
0:16:40.170 --> 0:16:41.400
cares about but it's okay

513
0:16:41.400 --> 0:16:43.770
alright everybody say a techie signing

514
0:16:43.770 --> 0:16:50.350
out

515
0:16:50.350 --> 0:16:54.280
okay okay okay okay I was just seeing to

516
0:16:54.280 --> 0:16:55.750
say I want to see how many people are

517
0:16:55.750 --> 0:16:57.640
actually gonna comment take you for God

518
0:16:57.640 --> 0:17:00.190
I'm like oh man you guys are funny all

519
0:17:00.190 --> 0:17:01.660
right here we go

520
0:17:01.660 --> 0:17:03.700
ichigo kurosaki main character the

521
0:17:03.700 --> 0:17:06.520
series bankai tensa zangetsu we don't

522
0:17:06.520 --> 0:17:07.780
actually know what the current tensa

523
0:17:07.780 --> 0:17:09.430
zangetsu looks like as he hasn't used it

524
0:17:09.430 --> 0:17:10.990
yet after it was reforged me my Bonnie

525
0:17:10.990 --> 0:17:13.900
Maya but his original bankai was pretty

526
0:17:13.900 --> 0:17:15.370
simple it just compressed down all the

527
0:17:15.370 --> 0:17:18.069
power into a cloak and his sword and he

528
0:17:18.069 --> 0:17:19.540
was able to launch black hits again ten

529
0:17:19.540 --> 0:17:22.000
shows a little bit more powerful the

530
0:17:22.000 --> 0:17:23.740
cloak was part of his bankai I guess

531
0:17:23.740 --> 0:17:25.930
I'll make that the fun fact and you can

532
0:17:25.930 --> 0:17:27.280
basically measure how much spiritual

533
0:17:27.280 --> 0:17:28.990
energy he has left based on how much of

534
0:17:28.990 --> 0:17:31.210
the cloak is still there this bankai was

535
0:17:31.210 --> 0:17:33.850
also shared by shiro ichigo or the

536
0:17:33.850 --> 0:17:35.980
hollow inside of ichigo before we found

537
0:17:35.980 --> 0:17:37.330
out what's up with that and it was

538
0:17:37.330 --> 0:17:38.950
basically the same exact thing except uh

539
0:17:38.950 --> 0:17:41.620
swapped color schemes there um yeah

540
0:17:41.620 --> 0:17:43.300
ichigo's bankai not really that

541
0:17:43.300 --> 0:17:45.820
interesting honestly is not as elaborate

542
0:17:45.820 --> 0:17:47.740
I guess I should say as the others oh it

543
0:17:47.740 --> 0:17:50.050
also gave him super speed which that

544
0:17:50.050 --> 0:17:51.970
kind of became trivial after a while to

545
0:17:51.970 --> 0:17:53.380
remember that remember when he first

546
0:17:53.380 --> 0:17:55.150
went bankai against pyaar kiya any speed

547
0:17:55.150 --> 0:17:56.620
blitz the fuck out of him it's like whoa

548
0:17:56.620 --> 0:17:59.200
ichigo's wicked fast now and then after

549
0:17:59.200 --> 0:18:00.460
that like every other opponent he's

550
0:18:00.460 --> 0:18:01.840
fought against the speed wasn't really

551
0:18:01.840 --> 0:18:03.370
like okay you're at least you're pretty

552
0:18:03.370 --> 0:18:05.290
faster on par with me I guess I guess

553
0:18:05.290 --> 0:18:07.090
gives you a decent decent speed I guess

554
0:18:07.090 --> 0:18:09.550
maybe possibly unless you're houki aura

555
0:18:09.550 --> 0:18:11.350
alright anyway hope you guys enjoyed the

556
0:18:11.350 --> 0:18:14.230
video um I might be making a video in

557
0:18:14.230 --> 0:18:15.760
the future about all the different star

558
0:18:15.760 --> 0:18:17.440
riders and their volt standings or at

559
0:18:17.440 --> 0:18:18.460
least they're different individual

560
0:18:18.460 --> 0:18:20.110
powers cuz we know all of them I'll

561
0:18:20.110 --> 0:18:21.400
leave a comment below on what you think

562
0:18:21.400 --> 0:18:23.650
and what is your favorite bankai hope

563
0:18:23.650 --> 0:18:51.370
you enjoyed teching signing out

564
0:18:51.370 --> 0:18:59.370
you
